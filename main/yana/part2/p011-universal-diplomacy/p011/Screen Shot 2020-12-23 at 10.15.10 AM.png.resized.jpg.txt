Universal Diplomacy

During my travels, I discovered the key to ending cliff dancing—
the key for achieving world peace. It’s called universal diplo-
macy and is based upon a holonic understanding of the uni-
verse. So, now I must explain holons.

To begin, a holon is a thing that is both a whole and a
part. For example, this sentence is a holon; it is a whole
sentence as well as a part of this chapter. Furthermore, this
chapter is a holon; it is a whole chapter as well as a part of
this book. Everything is a holon.

There exists a binding force that brings holons together
to form greater holons. For example, birds come together
to form flocks, people come together to form neighborhoods,
neighborhoods come together to form cities and counties, cities
and counties come together to form states, and so on.

There also exists a counter force, one that causes holons
to collide and destroy each other. For example, when a bird
and a worm collide, sometimes the bird will eat the worm.

There is a tension between the binding force and the de-
structive force. It remains to be seen if the various nations of
Earth will destroy each other, or will bind together to form a
cohesive, peaceful union.

Now, a gluon is a holon that binds together peer holons, to
form greater holons. For example, sometimes when a couple
gets married, the marriage joins together two families, creat-
ing a new super family. In this case, the married couple is a
gluon. For another example, when atoms share electrons with
other atoms, the electrons act as gluons to bring the atoms
together to form molecules.

A universal gluon is a gluon that binds together all its
peers to form a new, greater holon. We need at least one
universal gluon to bring together all the nations of Earth, to
form a cohesive, peaceful union.
