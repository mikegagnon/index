We need the right diplomat to stand up, and become the
universal gluon that binds together the nations of Earth. For
such a stunt to succeed, the universal diplomat would need to
represent all people equally, and all nations equally. Imagine
a lawyer who is defending everyone against everyone else, to
create a balance among the holonic forces, ushering in peace.
