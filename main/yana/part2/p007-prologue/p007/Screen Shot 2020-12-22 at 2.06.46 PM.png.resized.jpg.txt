Prologue to Part IT

About halfway through the 20th century, Tibetan Buddhism
arrived in the United States. There’s a legend of a group of
monks who were on a tour of some governor’s mansion, or
something like that, and a vicious-sounding guard dog was
barking at them, while they walked through the backyard.
Then, suddenly, the dog broke free, and charged the monks,
full speed. Most of the monks immediately ran away, but one
monk charged the dog. Stunned by the unexpected situation,
the dog turned tail, and ran away.

Some Buddhists will tell you they believe the monk had
such a masterful awareness of the situation, that he knew the
dog would run away. I think that’s ridiculous. I believe the
monk charged the dog, because he knew that if he met the
dog halfway, the dog would attack him, and spare his fellow
monks.

Years later, Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, the brave monk,
gave an advanced talk to a group of advanced students who
were training to become saints. He said, “The idea of this
particular teaching is to give our blood and flesh to others.
That is a very powerful thing to do. It is like saying, ‘If you
want me, take me, possess me, kidnap me, control me. Go
ahead, do it. Take me. I’m at your service. You could cut
me into pieces or anything you want. Without your help, I
would not have any way to work with my journey at all.”

Scholars and adherents are divided on whether or not it’s
a metaphor. But, then again, Trungpa Rinpoche did run
towards the dog.
