Escape

I run across the street and hop into Jimmy’s car, parked right
behind the cop cars. Then, as calmly as I can muster, I say,
“We need to leave now.”

Jimmy doesn’t say a word, and slowly un-parks his car,
then drives away at the speed limit. I direct him towards Old
Town Alexandria, Virginia.

If you’re tuned in to the military drinking sub culture of
Washington D.C., then you know that Old Town Alexandria
is the most friendly place to be a drunk sailor, airman, soldier,
or marine.

“You didn’t get his signature,” Jimmy says.

“No, but I can go above the chain of command. Just so
you don’t freak out at our destination, I need to tell you about
superrationality.”
