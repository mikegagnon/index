Running the Psych Ward

I wheel prisoners around. I transcribe a prisonerâ€™s complaint
and turn it in. I persuade a fairy not to kill her mother. A
staff member screams at a prisoner, so I get in his face and
calmly let him know he needs to be more friendly.

A prisoner cries, so I do a dance for him, and he smiles.
Someone interrupts, asking for help. I give them a riddle: why
are you really here? and send them on their way. I entertain
the depressed man with more slapstick, until two prisoners
break into a fight, and I break it up while laughing, ho, ho,
ho. The staff straps me to a table, in a room all alone, with
my arm bent backwards at the elbow. This is their attempt
to crush my spirit, but I am indomitable.
