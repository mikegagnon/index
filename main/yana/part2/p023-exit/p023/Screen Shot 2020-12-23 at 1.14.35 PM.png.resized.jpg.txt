Exit

A few days into my stay at F-Unit, the psychiatrist and I
have one final conversation. I vow that, once released, I will
continue to take my “medication,” in perpetuity. Then, they
release me.

In a bathroom, I don my Franciscan monk’s robes, check
that I have my laptop, my phone, my American Spirit cigarettes,
and my BMD challenge coin, then spend a few minutes ar-
ranging the collection of all my possessions in my back-packing
pack, then walk out the front door, dropping the drugs they
gave me into the trash, on the way out.

My father stands next to his parked Lexus, with the front
passenger-door open.

“Good to see you, son,” he says.

But, I walk right past him, and step into Jimmy’s ancient
Corolla. Jimmy tells me: “You’re my hostage now,” and we
drive off.

“Turn off your phone, and hand it to me,” he says, and
I comply. Now that my phone is in his pocket, he says “Let
me see your coin.” I hand it to him. He inspects it, hands it
back, then drives us to his favorite music shop.
