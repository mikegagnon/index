back, reach into his pocket, grab his car keys, let him go, and
I sprint away towards his car.

He chases me, but I’m faster. He shouts out, “The deal’s
cancelled Yana Zendo! You just fucked up!”

But I run. I know he’s full of shit; I already have his
signature. I’m approaching his car, pop his trunk, reach in,
grab the Spirits, toss the Souls into his trunk, drop the keys
on the ground, and sprint away.
