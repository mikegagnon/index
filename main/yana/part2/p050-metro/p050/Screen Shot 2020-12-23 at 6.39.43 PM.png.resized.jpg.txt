Metro Parking Garage

Under a stairwell, in the basement of a Metro parking garage,
I wake up early in the morning. It seems right around sunrise.
The birds are chirping and it’s killing my brain. I’ve got
a killer headache, and all the adrenaline is gone. I begin
crying. Is it because I’ve pulled off the Iran Nuclear Deal? Is
it because I jeopardized it? I don’t know.

I check and make sure I have the carton of Spirits. I do.
But, then I notice there’s a pack missing from the carton. I
realize, I never took the pack of Spirits from Jimmy’s pocket.
He still has a pack!

Groaning, I fumble around in my pocket for my phone. I
pull it out, and think about calling Jimmy, wondering what
he’s going to say. Maybe I just destroyed the whole Iran
Nuclear Deal last night. Maybe I should call Jimmy, maybe I
should try to mend what I’ve done. But what weapons does
he have? What other Iranian or ISIS soldiers are roaming
right now?

My phone rings. It’s Jimmy. I want to answer, I want to
get those Spirits, but I can’t bring myself to answer his call.
I want to fix the deal, but I’m terrified of Jimmy. I’m more
afraid of losing my own life than I am afraid of losing the
last pack of Spirits, afraid of losing the deal. And although I
recognize my fear, I’m turning away, because I do not want to
die. And, that’s when I realize, I’m not enlightened anymore.
