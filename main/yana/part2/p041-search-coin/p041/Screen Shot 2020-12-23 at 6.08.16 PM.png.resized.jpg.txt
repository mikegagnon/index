Searching for the right coin

In my parent’s bedroom, I turn to look at the stand presenting
my father’s collection of the dozens of challenge coins he’s
earned over the years. At the top left is the personal coin of
a one-star Air Force General. It’s General Sam Bellow’s coin.
Although the coin only has one star on it, it’s more valuable
than it looks. Yes, it’s an old personal coin, but Sam Bellow
is now a retired four-star general—and, formerly, the Vice
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

“We need to talk to you Tharpa,” my father says.

I’m concerned though that if I were to present that coin
to someone, they might not recognize its significance, or they
could pretend not to recognize its significance. I need to cap-
ture an undeniably powerful coin.

“Let us in!” my father shouts, and I hear the door banging.

The next coin simply has “CIA Directorate of Operations”
engraved upon it, with all the color and minute flourishings
of a genuine CIA challenge coin. My father once told me, the
coin is very rare. Hardly anyone in the CIA even has this
coin.

I hear a slam against the door, so I panic, grab the coin,
and hop out the bedroom window, onto a fire escape—suddenly
realizing this coin is way too powerful. But, it’s too late; I
must escape.
