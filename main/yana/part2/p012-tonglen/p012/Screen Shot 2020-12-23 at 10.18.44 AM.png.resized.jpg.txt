Tonglen

To become a universal diplomat, you must, for each person
on Earth, learn how they think, why they think that way,
what’s hurting them, and how to heal them. You must be-
come everyone, every perspective, step by step, perspective
by perspective.

Fortunately, there’s an advanced Buddhist meditation tech-
nique for becoming a universal diplomat. It’s called tonglen,
and only works if you’ve already achieved a certain degree
of enlightenment. And, for tonglen to transform you into a
universal diplomat, you must perform tonglen for each person
on Earth.

Before performing tonglen for a person, you first sit down
on a meditation cushion with good posture, and perform ba-
sic “shamatha” meditation, for a period of time, to bring you
fully into the present moment without discursive thoughts.
Your mind should be like a flat lake. Finally, you begin the
actual practice of tonglen by repeatedly breathing out joy to
your person, selflessly giving away your own joy, then breath-
ing in their suffering, selflessly taking on their suffering, for
their benefit.

When you perform tonglen correctly, you literally become
the other person, and the other person literally becomes you.
Through this practice, I literally became everyone on Earth,
thereby becoming a universal diplomat.
