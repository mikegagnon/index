Assassins

“Hashish is sacred. The English word assassin comes from
Persia, hundreds of years ago, and literally means hashish
smoker. The original assassins lived in the mountains and
communed with God by smoking hashish. Only occasionally
did they come down to the cities, to balance The Powers.”

“Tm not going to kill anyone,” I say.

“This is WW0. We’re going to assassinate concepts and
ideas.”
