XYZ Promotions

During my travels, I discovered a formula for kickstarting de-
centralized Groupon promotions—which I named XYZ pro-
motions. Assuming you have a great DJ friend, it works as
follows.

‘You walk up to the owner or manager of a club, and say:
“If I were to deliver to you X customers on a Sunday night,
by DJing for you, how much would you be willing to pay me
for that?” Let the response equal $Y. I.e., the owner is willing
to pay $Y to receive X customers. Take $Y and divide it by
two: ie., $Z = $x. Keep $Z for the DJ, as profit. Then
give each of the first X customers a coupon worth $Z. The
coupons are only redeemable if at least X customers show up.
Also, it might be better to take a smaller profit in order to
offer bigger coupons, but that’s just a matter of optimization.

The owner loves this deal because it is very low risk; the
owner only pays out if the owner gets what they want. Now
my friends are incentivized to recruit their friends to come to
the club with them. And that’s the most fun way to go toa
club anyway.

The DJ loves this deal, I love this deal, the owner loves
this deal, my friends love this deal, and their friends love this
deal. Win, win, all the way around.
