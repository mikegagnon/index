CIA HQ

He tells me to drive him to CIA HQ, with him in the passenger
seat. I ask him if he could navigate and he just tells me to
shut the fuck up and drive us there. I have no idea how to get
to CIA HQ—only a vague notion of where it is geographically.
It’s not the part of Northern Virginia that I’m familiar with.
And, the streets lack signs that say: “Turn here for CIA.”

So, I drive and do the best I can. I get to the first uncertain
turn, and look at him; he is gazing off to the right. “Do I turn,
here?” I ask and he says: “Shut up and drive,” so I turn right.
“I knew you knew how to get to CIA.” Then, following his
unconscious directions, I drive us all the way there, right up
to the point where we see the entrance to CIA HQ.
