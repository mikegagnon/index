Government Friends

I asked my father to introduce me to his government friends,
so we could actually succeed in negotiating with Iran.

He wouldn’t help, telling me, “You’re not well.” So, I asked
him just to listen to me, so he could judge the soundness of
my idea himself. He’s a smart guy, but he declined, then I
demanded, then I realized he was trying to cliff dance with
me, so I decided to out cliff dance him. One thing led to
another, and now I’m in a psych ward.
