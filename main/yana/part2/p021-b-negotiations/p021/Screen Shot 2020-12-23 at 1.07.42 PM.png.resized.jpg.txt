Beginning of Negotiations

Jimmy doesn’t want to negotiate. He says he couldn’t care
less about an Iran Nuclear Deal. He just wants a bigger mi-
crophone, so he can DJ bigger venues. I ask him how much a
microphone would cost, and he says $800 to start. I offer to
buy him a microphone once we’re released, and he says that’s
a start.
