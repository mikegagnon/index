Fight Night

‘We're drinking beer and smoking hashish, when Jimmy switches
the channel to a UFC fight. “Oh look, it’s an Iranian vs. an
Trishman tonight. You must be Irish,” he says. I nod.

He says: “Legend has it, you know jiu jitsu. Do you really
know jiu jitsu?”

I say: “I know a lot about jiu jitsu.”

“T bet you a hundo, the Iranian wins,” he says. I decline
the wager.

We watch the fight. It goes almost a full fifteen min-
utes, and then the Iranian submits the Irishman with a funky
chokehold.

“Ha! I told you! You better watch your back Yana Zendo,
I know jiu jitsu!” and he punches me in the arm.

“Wait!” I shout. I point to a little Red Bull logo, rotating
in the lower-right-hand corner of the screen. “I have an idea.”
