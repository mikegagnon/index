a round, each player who comes in second place earns a near-
victory token. At the end of the fourth round, everyone who
has the second-most number of near-victory tokens, wins the
game. Rational strategies for this game produce large, mutli-
way ties.

On one hand, you might think you would need to get
all players at the table to agree to play First Loser Wins,
but actually, the game is backwards compatible with existing
games of global domination. For instance, say you’re playing
Risk. If other players believe you’re winning, they will team
up against you, and you will lose. But if you aim for second
place, you will hopefully be a part of the winning coalition
that knocks out the first-place player. Therefore, it’s ratio-
nal to aim for second place, and consequently, if everyone is
rational, no-one will achieve dominance, and the game will
eventually end in an all-way tie.

With regards to the Iran Nuclear Deal, if Iran simply gets
to program the American Jumbotron, then the United States
Government loses, which (a) the United States simply won’t
tolerate, and (b) everyone will gun after Iran thereafter, be-
cause Iran is now the #1 power. But if Iran lets the United
States DJ Tehran, then both Iran and the United States lose,
in a tie for second place, and, therefore, both win. It’s a
mathematically sound strategy for balancing The Powers.
