Kathryn

Jimmy turns on my phone. Dozens of text messages flow in.
Everyone in my family was texting me, and a few friends too,
all wondering where I was, and was I OK, and oh, by the way,
we've filed a missing person’s report, and the police are after
you now.

Jimmy dials my sister Kathryn, on speakerphone.

“Kathryn, I need a favor.”

“Are you manic?”

“I’m enlightened.”

“Are you OK?”

“I’m fine, please just listen”

There’s silence, then she asks: “Am I on speaker?”

“No. I’m negotiating the Iran Nuclear Deal, and I need
Red Bull’s help. I think we can both agree that there’s at
least a very small chance that I really am negotiating the
Iran Nuclear Deal. Even if the probability is only 0.00001%,
then it’s worth it to pursue the deal because world peace is
on the line. And if it turns out I’m delusional, there will be
no harm.”

“There would be harm. If I indulge you in your delusions,
you'll just become more delusional.”

“Will you just listen to my idea? You'll find it harmless.”

Silence. Then I continue.

“Red Bull sponsors a new art collective that exemplifies
the image Red Bull wants to sell. We throw a party and we
split the profit. That’s it.”

“Tm not going to help.”

Silence.

“If you say deal, I’ll turn myself in, and that’s part of the
deal... just say deal.”

Silence. Then, she says, “Deal...” Then, “Please don’t
hang up.”
