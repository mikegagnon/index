Footnote

According to one school of Tibetan Buddhism, once you’re
enlightened you’re supposed to live your life according to a
book titled, So Now You’re Enlightened (rough translation).
The book says, you should never use violence. But then,
in a footnote in one of the appendices, it says: “Violence is
OK when it’s necessary” (rough translation). Enlightened
violence is referred to as “wrathful compassion.”
