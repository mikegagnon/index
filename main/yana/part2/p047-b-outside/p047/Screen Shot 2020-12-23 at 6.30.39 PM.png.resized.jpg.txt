Outside

As soon as we're clear of the doorman, he throws a right
hook, but I duck under, and tackle him. We tussle, I end up
on top, raise my fist to strike, then invite him to surrender.
He accepts my invitation, so I let him go. He stands up,
straightens out his jacket, and walks away, without turning
back.

Now the doorman won’t let Jimmy and me back inside,
and I wonder if it might be game over. I suggest to Jimmy
we just hang outside the bar. He’s concerned the police will
come. I say, “Those marines inside, they’re not really marines.
And if they’re not marines, then Rook probably isn’t going
to call the police. We have to take the risk.”

We’re just standing outside, freezing our asses off, so I ask
Jimmy, “If I smoke a Spirit, does it kill an American?” He
says no. Then I ask, “If you smoke a Soul, does it kill an
Iranian?” He says no. So, we trade cigarettes and smoke.
