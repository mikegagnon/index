A few minutes into our cigarettes, Jimmy says: “You told
me you didn’t know jiu jitsu,” and I nod. He refrains from
threatening my life.

The lady from the group at the table steps outside. “Can
I borrow a smoke?” Jimmy offers her a Spirit.

“What was that fight all about?” she asks.

I laugh, and say: “Well, he thought his coin outranked
mine.”

“Can I see your coin?” she asks.

“Do you have a coin?” I ask.

“No,” she says.

“I don’t have a coin either,” I say.

“Fine,” she says.

There is a pause.

“Hi, I’m Jimmy,” Jimmy says.

They shake hands.

“What do you do for a living, Jimmy?”

“I’m ISIS,” he says.

We all laugh.

Then, I look at her, and say, “He’s not joking, he really is
ISIS. And, I am too, and also CIA. We come in peace.” Then,
I hand her my BMD coin.

She studies it, looks up at me, and asks: “Where were you
stationed?” And I tell her. Then she asks: “What was the
outcome of the war game?” And I tell her.

She laughs, and pulls out her coin. It’s a Secret Service
coin.

“T have the Iran Nuclear deal,” I say.

I pull out the signed document, and hand it to her. She
studies it for a few minutes.

“How do I know this is real?”

I pull out my Souls and show them to her. “I’ve got
Iranian cigarettes.” Then she reaches fast and swipes the
cigarettes from me. I look at Jimmy. He looks OK. She
looks at the cigarettes, then pulls one out.
