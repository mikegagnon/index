Transfer

I re-enter the ward with the plan of running Zen Beer Garden
again. Immediately though, a hand goes up, this time from a
guy who has been standing on the periphery the entire time.
I jog up to him.

He smiles and says, “Hi, I’m Jimmy,” and extends his
hand for a handshake.

“Y’m Yana Zendo,” and we shake hands.

There’s a pause.

Task: “So, what’s up?”

With a smile, he says, “You’re DJing the whole place.
Manually.”

Then another fight breaks out, I get in the middle of it, and
the police take me away to the state-run Northern Virginia
Mental Health Institute.
