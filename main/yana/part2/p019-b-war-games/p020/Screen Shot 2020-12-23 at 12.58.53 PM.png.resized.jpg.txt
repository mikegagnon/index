Open Borders and Global Basic Income

 

Another essay goes like this:

World peace will be marked by open borders. Countries
will freely enforce their own laws, so long as they follow the
bare minimal Constitution of Earth. If you don’t like your
country’s laws, you can freely go to another country with
laws you prefer.

Of course, there would be a challenge, because everyone’s
going to want to fly to the countries with the best economic
opportunities. To prevent economic flight, we need to give ev-
eryone on Earth a basic income, say US $1k a month, perhaps
adjusted for local cost-of-living rates. Such a basic income
will provide many benefits, both obvious and less obvious, at
a reasonable cost, as discussed in published literature that is
beyond the scope of this essay.
