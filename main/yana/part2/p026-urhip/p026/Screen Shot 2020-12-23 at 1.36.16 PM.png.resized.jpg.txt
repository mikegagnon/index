Urhip

We are back at Jimmy’s house, sharing a blunt, but it doesn’t
affect me much, because I’m already enlightened. But Jimmy
had insisted, so I obliged.

Ilay back on Jimmy’s bed, listening to music blast through
his speakers. The basis for the song is a classic house beat,
but the song takes enjoyable, unpredictable turns, with throw-
backs to Baltimore Club and D.C. Go Go, complete with
electro drops. I would have expected such an eclectic mix to
sound bizarre, but it somehow all comes together in such a
way that I almost always feel I know where it will go next, but,
instead, the music is full of pleasant surprises. It’s Jimmy’s
music.

“How would you feel about negotiating?” I ask.

“I want to DJ the Middle East.”

The Middle East is the most urhipster, underground music
venue of Washington D.C.. Jimmy’s music is genuinely good,
but is it sufficiently urhipster urhip? I’m not familiar enough
with music to know, but I have an idea.

“Could you DJ this Sunday?” I ask.

“It’s closed on Sundays,” he says.

“I know. Let’s go tonight to book you for Sunday.”
