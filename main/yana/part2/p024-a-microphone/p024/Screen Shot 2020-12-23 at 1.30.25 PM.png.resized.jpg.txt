Microphone

In Jimmy’s tiny, basement-level apartment, in Arlington, Vir-
ginia, I hand Jimmy his brand new mic. He has a large vinyl
collection, turn tables, huge speakers, and an impressive col-
lection of cannabis flower.

“I didn’t think you would actually pull through with the
coin or the mic. A lot of people talk shit, and can’t back it
up. Fucking CIA.”

“What do you mean, ‘fucking CIA?”

“Play dumb with me again, and I’ll chop off your fucking
head.”

Pause.

Then I ask, “Can we negotiate now?”

“First let’s drive to CIA headquarters.”

“I don’t think that’s wise.”

“Do you want a deal!?”
