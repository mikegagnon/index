Hacking Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)

 

One of my essays goes like this:

Several years ago, I was standing behind the podium of the
War Room of the Pentagon, and I said “Hit it.” My colleague
pushed a button, which launched a high-density cyberbomb
that I had programmed, and it took the United States Bal-
listic Missile Defense system offline. It was just part of a war
game, which was a waste of my time, I thought; I should have
been out in the field, conducting real operations. But now,
I’m grateful there’s no blood on my hands.
