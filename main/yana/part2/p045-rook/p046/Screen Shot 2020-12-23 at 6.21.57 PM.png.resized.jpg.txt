I say, “Can I buy you guys a round?”

They look at each other, consensus arises, and they say
“Yes!”

So, I buy them beer, they thank me, and they continue
their drinking songs, I join in for just one song, then leave.
They continue their merriment. Jimmy and I sit in the back,
drinking beer.

A guy from outside the marine-look-alike group runs up
to me, and says “Hi!” so I buy him a drink and we have small
chit chat. One thing leads to another, and our challenge coins
are on the table, but I didn’t pull the CIA coin. I pulled my
BMD coin.

He says, “I win, you owe me a beer!” and laughs and slaps
the table with his hand.

I feign contempt. He has a one-star general coin—a coin
some one-star had given him for a good briefing at the Pen-
tagon or something like that, whereas my coin represents my
role in ending WW4.

I say: “No, I win. Look at my coin,” and then I explain
the intricate symbolism pervading the coin, and how it was
a part of a hacking operation with far bigger consequences,
and I do this without revealing any classified information, but
with sufficient detail that he should be able to read between
the lines and understand what my coin represents.

He says, “You owe me a beer.”

I say, “Try your plastic coin on those guys,” and point to
the look-alike marines at the table.

He says, “Fuck you.”

According to ZBG, and the Jiu-Jitsu Honor-Defense Pro-
tocol, it’s time to bounce this guy. Or, maybe he’s bouncing
me. Either way, I must proceed the same way. I say, “Do you
want to take this outside?”

He accepts my invitation.
