Rook

 

Once we get sufficiently drunk, we walk about a half mile
down the street, towards the waterfront. We approach Rook,
an Irish pub, where all the US military go to drink.

Jimmy says: “This is bad for me.”

I say, “Be cool.”

The doorman lets us in, and I activate ZBG and superra-
tionality. The bar is empty, except for a few people here and
there, and a group of 9 gentlemen, and one lady, all sitting
along a long table, clearly drunk, singing drinking songs, and
having merriment. They look like marines, except their hair
is slightly too long.

Now it’s my move. I walk up to the look-alike marine
table, and say: “Hey, are you guys marines?”

One of them looks at me and shouts: “Fuck yeah!”
