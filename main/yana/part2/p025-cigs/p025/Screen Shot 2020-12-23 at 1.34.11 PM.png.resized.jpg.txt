Cigarettes

On the car ride back from CIA, I exhale a plume of cigarette
smoke, while Jimmy opens up his glove compartment, then
pulls something out. He shows me a short-and-thin pack of
cigarettes with the silhouette of a man on the front, and some
wording in a calligraphic alphabet I can’t identify.

“What's that?” I ask.

“Tranian cigarettes. We call them Souls. I’ll trade you a
pack of Souls for a carton of American Spirits.”

“Sure,” I say, then we stop at a 7-eleven, and make our
trade.

Then he says: “Don’t smoke it.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Don’t play dumb. If you smoke a Soul, I’ll chop your
head off.”
