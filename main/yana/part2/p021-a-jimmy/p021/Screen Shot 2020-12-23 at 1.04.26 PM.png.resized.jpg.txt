Jimmy

The next day, while writing essays, Jimmy, from the previous
psych ward, enters F-Unit. He smiles, walks over to me, and
sits down.

“Can I read what you’re writing?” he asks.

“Yes, please,” I respond, then hand him my stack of essays.

He reads every word, then eventually turns to me and
says, “You're a genius.”

“Takes one to know one,” I reply, while still carefully writ-
ing words upon my current essay.

“Tm from Iran,” he says.

I look up, and say: “I’m from Virginia.”

“I’m ISIS,” he says.

Having previously tonglened ISIS, I reply: “Me too.”

There is a pause. Then, I ask him: “Why are you here, in
the psych ward?”

He says: “I’m your Iranian counterpart. They put us here
so we could meet.”

Task: “Are you a hacker?”

He replies: “No, I’m a DJ.”
