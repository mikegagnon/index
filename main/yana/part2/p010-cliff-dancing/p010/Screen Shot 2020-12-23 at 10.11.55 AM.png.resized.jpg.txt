Cliff Dancing

My father once served as the Chief Strategist for the US Air
Force, and he once described to me the game-theoretically
rational, and totally insane strategy that nuclearly armed na-
tion states follow. It’s called cliff dancing, and works as fol-
lows. Imagine you are standing at the edge of a cliff, and
are chained, at the ankles, to your adversary. If either of you
falls off the cliff, you both fall off the cliff (mutually assured
destruction). Furthermore, there’s a prize both of you want
very much (global domination), and the only way one of you
can receive the prize is by convincing the other to tap out.
So what do you do?

According to the world’s brightest idiots, you start danc-
ing on the edge of the cliff, to convince your adversary you
are crazy and they should tap out. And, when your adversary
starts dancing on the edge of the cliff, you should dance even
more erratically, to prove to them it’s not a charade, and you
truly are crazy, and they should tap out.

So, right now, we’ve got a bunch of idiots trying to out-
crazy each other, and wouldn’t it be nice if we could prevent
further entrants into this dance?
