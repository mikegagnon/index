Epilogue to Part II

The depression following a schizoaffective-bipolar-manic at-
tack is pretty bad. It lasts between three to six months, and
you're sporadically wondering if it’s better just to die or to
continue living another few months in this state of being.

My own enlightenment was the foundation of all my other
beliefs. Reflecting, I don’t think I was ever enlightened, ex-
cept for perhaps a few brief moments after my mind popped,
and before ego took over. So, with enlightenment gone, the
other beliefs started to crumble. Over a 12-month, back-and-
forth journey, I tried to figure out what really happened, and
what was imaginary. But there are at least a few things I
know for sure, including: (1) Jimmy and I really did negoti-
ate, (2) I really did submit a few pieces of paper to someone
outside of a bar who claimed to be Secret Service, and (3) I’m
too afraid to answer Jimmy’s phone calls.
