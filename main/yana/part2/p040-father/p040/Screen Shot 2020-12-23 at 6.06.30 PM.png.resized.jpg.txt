Father

My father comes out of his bedroom, I ask them to sit down.
I explain everything to them, then pull out the signed deal,
and ask for my father’s signature.

He says, “I need a minute to think about this...”

And then, there’s a knock on the door. My mother stands
up, walks over to the door, opens it, and there’s two police
officers.

Oh shit. Why didn’t I anticipate this? I look around,
looking for ideas, there’s a fire escape right next to me; I
could just hop out the living-room window. But, a better
idea comes to mind, and I run into my parent’s bedroom and
lock the door.

The police must have rushed in, because they’re knocking
on the bedroom door, and saying: “We need you to come
out.”
