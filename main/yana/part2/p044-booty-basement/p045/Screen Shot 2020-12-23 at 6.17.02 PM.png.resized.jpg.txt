someone places my coins on the table, between Jimmy and
me.
“Holy fucking shit, you captured the CIA! What an idiot,”
Jimmy shouts, and laughs. He reaches over to pick up my
coins, but I grab his hand. He looks up at me calmly.

“You're in Iran. Let go,” he says.

“Stop. You’ve got the United States in war-game check-
mate, and if you hold those coins for much longer, the United
States is going to abandon this war game, and it’s going to
be total war—World War 1, 2, 3, 4 all at once, and every-
one’s going to die, and needless to say, we’re both going to
die on the spot. I don’t know how much time we have, but
you should give back those coins now.”

Then, the doorman walks up to us, and says: “What’s
going on?”

“He’s trying to steal my coins,” I say.

The doorman asks Jimmy: “Is this true?”

Jimmy lets go of the coins, I put them back in my pocket,
and we start drinking.
