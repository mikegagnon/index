Obama and Iran

Obama has announced the US Government has just begun
negotiating a deal with Iran. Obama has further announced,
via a “leak” to the New York Times, that unofficial, off-the-
record diplomats will conduct the negotiations. Of course,
this means me.

The general idea is to lift sanctions from Iran, essentially
moving towards an alliance, in exchange for Iran to perpet-
ually offer inspections that guarantee Iran is not working to-
wards nuclear armament. This could be the key to peace
in the Middle East, which would pave the way for peace on
Earth. However, Iran seems reluctant to negotiate, and has
basically said: “Make me an offer that I actually like.”
