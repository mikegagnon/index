The News

Jimmy and I are watching FOX news. He teaches me how to
read between the lines of whatever’s on TV, to consciously
unwrap the subliminal messages from The Powers.

“These days, movies, TV shows—everything on the Jumbo-
tron—is produced on demand to present programming in
rapid response to current events. That 3D Marvel movie that
just came out today. It didn’t take years to produce; it took
days. I guarantee you the movie’s about us—preparing the
public for a potential Iran Nuclear Deal.”

Then he continues. “Almost everyone’s a Manchurian
drone. They receive their instructions from the Jumbotron.
Most people have very little free will.”

“But if you switch to a different channel, you can choose
different programming, right?”

“First of all, people rarely switch channels. But yes, there
is a limited opportunity for drones to choose their program-
ming. However when the programs argue with each other,
it only serves to convince the drones there are only so many
allowable perspectives. It requires plenty of free will to think
outside official narratives.”

“What official narrative do you want on the Jumbotron?”

“To end all war, we must balance The Powers.”
