Challenge Coins

A challenge coin is a wartime, anything goes, shit’s fucked
up, who the fuck are you, here’s proof, US Government iden-
tification card.

The challenge coin tradition originated during World War
2, and the original idea was that everyone in a military unit
received a specially designed coin, tailored to their unit, and
you’re supposed to carry it on you, at all times. Then, in an
emergency situation, you can prove your group membership
by presenting your coin. Sometimes, individuals make per-
sonal coins, which they give out as big thank-you gestures.

Challenge coins are also a drinking game. At a beer gar-
den, you can compare coins with a stranger. Whoever has
the most elite coin wins, and the loser has to buy the winner
a beer.

Jimmy wants me to prove to him I that I actually hacked
BMD. I told him, once released, I will show him my BMD
coin—an Air Force coin that commemorates the BMD war
game I hacked.
