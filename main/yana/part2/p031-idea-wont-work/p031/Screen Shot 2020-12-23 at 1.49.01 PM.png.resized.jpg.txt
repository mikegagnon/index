An Idea That Won’t Work

Back at Jimmy’s apartment, I have an idea that makes me
wince, but it just might work. I say: “I have an idea for
getting you on the Jumbotron, but you might not like it.”

Jimmy says: “You’re a fucking idiot. I know what you’re
thinking and we’d both be dead before we even got arrested.”

Then Jimmy explains, in the tradition of the LulzSec and
AntiSec hacking campaigns, the obvious way for any suffi-
ciently talented hacker to get airtime on the American Jum-
botron, is to vandalize the web pages for CIA, NSA, DoD,
etc. If your vandalism conveys an enticing message, the me-
dia will pick it up, and your message will be broadcast. And,
if you’re capable of nuking BMD USA, yow’re probably capa-
ble of defacing a few poorly secured public-facing WordPress
installations.

The way I saw it though, there was a problem. To evade
attribution of such a crime, you would have to setup prox-
ies before you’re being surveilled, and you’d also be wise to
setup blue-pill honey pots to throw your scent into turtles-all-
the-down rabbit holes. But, since I was already being power
surveilled by The Powers, there’s no way I could setup proxies
and honey pots, to evade attribution. In other words, if we
were to pull this off, we’d certainly be caught.

But rather than going to prison, we would be killed be-
fore even committing the crime. Jimmy says: “You need to
understand the rules of World War 0.”
