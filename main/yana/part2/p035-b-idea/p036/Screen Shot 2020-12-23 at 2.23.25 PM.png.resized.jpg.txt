He points his finger at me, and says: “If you lie to me, I
am going to kill you right now.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Are you CIA?”

“Why are you asking me?”

“Are you CIA!? Don’t lie to me.”

“Yes,” I respond.

“Are you lying to me?”

“No,” I respond.

“Why do you want Eric to DJ Tehran?”

“No.”

“Why not?”

“Because, if you kill me, there’s no deal.”

“Are you ISIS?”

“Yes, and...”

“Shut up... Tell me, what’s reverse game theory and
what’s First Loser Wins?”
