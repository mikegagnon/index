message to another cell, you might need to leave your bath-
room light on, overnight.

Furthermore, the war has turned into a kind of live-fire
war game. Symbolic bartering and negotiations in D.C., and
elsewhere, are backed up by live-fire kinetic actions in the
field. In this war game, everything’s a symbol. When a bishop
slides behind enemy lines and captures a rook in the game,
there’s consequences. For example, now that Jimmy has that
$800 microphone gift, it means the New York Times is now
amplifying Jimmy’s voice. This morning, they published an
ISIS apologist as an op-ed—which pissed off a lot of Ameri-
cans, but hey it’s the New York Times.

Jimmy concludes by telling me he had been watching Eric,
and he was certain Eric was Russian intel. And, in his words:
“Your homie Eric here, mister CIA numero dos, means the
CIA truly runs the Middle East and I didn’t have a fucking
clue, but now I know, thanks to you.”

Time slows. Holy shit. Everything makes perfect sense.
Why hadn’t I seen this before? But, then I become concerned.

“Jimmy, what do cigarettes represent?”

“They’re hostages. When you light up a Soul, an Iranian
dies. When I light up a Spirit, an American dies. Now that I
know you’ve captured the Middle East,” Jimmy says, “I want
to be on the American Jumbotron: American TV, American
radio, and millions of high-quality American hits on YouTube.
That’s my final offer.”

I say: “I don’t know how to get that for you.”

“Figure it out, or there’s no Iran deal. And also, I chop
off your head.”
