The Powers

Most people around the world believe Snowden’s a double
agent. That is, he was working for NSA, and then betrayed
NSA, becoming a double agent by informing the public about
NSA’s surveillance apparatus. But, the truth is, according to
Jimmy, Snowden’s a triple agent—he’s been working for NSA
all along, and now he’s just pretending to be a double agent.
The truth is, NSA’s surveillance apparatus is stupefyingly
more sophisticated and powerful than Snowden’s “leaks” re-
veal. According to the “leaks,” NSA doesn’t have a grip on
terrorism, and therefore NSA dragnets everyone. However, in
reality, NSA is so good, they’ve narrowed down their search
and are power surveilling every single person-of-interest with
legion NSA intelligence operatives. When they surveil you,
they don’t rent out an apartment across the street and watch
you with a telescope. They buy out the whole neighborhood
and inject operatives everywhere into your life. They’re your
coworkers, your friends, they serve you beer at clubs, they’re
everyone. It’s a massive gas-light attack. Nothing is what it
seems.

The whole point of the “leaks” was to fool the terrorists
into feeling safe. But, they didn’t count on everyone else’s
counter-intel being so good. Iran swaggerjacked the United
States and now they’re gas-lighting all the Western intelli-
gence operatives who are now stuck in the Middle East. The
United States figured out what Iran knew, and what they
were up to, and Iran figured out that the United States had
figured it out, and eventually they both had total awareness
of the situation. P.S. ISIS intel is plugged into American intel
and Iranian intel.

In this environment, where no one trusts anyone, and ev-
eryone can see what everyone else sees, the only way to carry
forward is by running cells, where operatives only know the
identities and roles of their cell mates. If you need to send a
