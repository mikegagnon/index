Zen Beer Garden

Zen Beer Garden (ZBG) prevents overloads by employing
bouncers and doormen. If a doorman to a garden wants to
let someone into the garden, but the garden is full, then the
doorman asks the bouncer for help. The bouncer then finds
the person in the garden who has been there the longest, and
kicks them out—making room for the new patron.

Furthermore, every patron in the garden is guaranteed at
least five minutes of time in the garden. So, what happens
when a would-be patron wants to enter the garden, but no
one has yet gone over time? Well, the doorman gives a task
to the would-be patron at the door, and sends them on their
way. To be admitted to the garden, the person must complete
their task and prove to the doorman that they have finished
their task. Most likely, there will be space in the garden at
this point (I have a math proof).

Beer Gardens are Zen because the tasks are riddles de-
signed to enlighten the minds of the people in line.

Lastly, I would also like to mention that nation states
can use ZBG to defend their systems against high-density
cyberbombs. Though in cyberspace, it’s probably impractical
to use Zen riddles. Rather, brute-force cryptographic hash-
cracking puzzles seem most practical. This was the topic of
my Harvard thesis.
