My Parent’s Condo

I use my key to enter my parent’s condo in Northwest D.C..
The lights are on, and the news is on the TV.

“Hey Mom, hey Dad,” I say, as I walk into the living room.

“Tharpa!” my mother shouts, and runs over to me, and
gives me a hug. “Where have you been?” she asks.

“T’ll explain soon, right now I need to talk to Dad.”

“He’s on the phone.”

And I turn to see my father walk into his bedroom, with
his phone to his ear, and he closes the door behind him.

“Dad! I need to talk to you.”

“Hold on a minute, I’m on the phone.”

“Dad! I need to talk to you right now.”

Silence. I turn to my mother, she asks again: “Where
have you been?”

‘Tl tell you, but let’s wait for Dad.”
