F-Unit

A staff member escorts me to my unit, which is named F-
Unit. As I enter F-Unit, I am greeted by a choir of prisoners
voluntarily singing from a bandstand.

Amazing Grace,

How sweet the sound,

That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost,

But now am found.

Tâ€™was blind but now I see...

Icry.
