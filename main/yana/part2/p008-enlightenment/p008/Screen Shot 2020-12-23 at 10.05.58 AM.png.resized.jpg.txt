Enlightenment

My mind popped, and I named my new self Xavier Yana
Zendo, which roughly translates to Saintly Mobile Meditation
Hall. After months of intense exertion, I am now a medita-
tion master who has transcended the need for formal sitting
meditation practice, because my mind is now constantly fresh
with indestructible presence. Having achieved enlightenment,
Iam committed to the singular mission of peacefully ushering
in world peace, as quickly as possible.

My parents think it’s impossible that I could become en-
lightened after such a short period of study and practice, but
they do not understand Buddhism. My enlightenment is to-
tally reasonable when you consider that I have a particular
genius for connecting the dots that other people don’t even
see, and, furthermore, I put even more exertion towards my
enlightenment than I did towards my master’s at Harvard or
as a hacker for the US military.
