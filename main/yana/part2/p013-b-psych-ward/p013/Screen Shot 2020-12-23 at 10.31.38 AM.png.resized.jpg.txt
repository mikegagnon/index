Psych ward

The psych ward here is crazy. It’s small, crowded, the staff
isn’t kind, and the psychiatrist doesn’t believe anything I
say. Prisoners are crying, prisoners are fighting, and a few
of the staff are prone to screaming. There’s even prisoners
in wheelchairs, who are stuck in random corners of the room
because they lack the capacity to wheel themselves.

As an enlightened meditation master, it is my responsibil-
ity to run the psych ward. This effort might seem daunting
because I lack the official designation as “staff,” and because
of the sheer volume of work that needs to be done. However,
during my travels, I fortunately discovered an algorithm that
I can employ to help everyone here, including the staff, with-
out becoming overloaded myself. The algorithm is called Zen
Beer Garden, and informs one how to be lazy and successful
at the same time during overload situations.
