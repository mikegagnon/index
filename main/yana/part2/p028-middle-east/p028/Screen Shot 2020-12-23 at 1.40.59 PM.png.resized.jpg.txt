The Middle East

Having told me I look ridiculous in my monk’s robes, Jimmy
insisted I buy a denim-on-denim streetwear suit at G-Star,
so I did. With me donning my fresh, new suit, we enter the
Middle East, and right away, I see my old hacker friend, Eric,
from the Air Force, spinning the music. It’s a house remix of
Zombie, by the Cranberries.

I dance up to him, leaving Jimmy behind.

“Tharpa!” Eric shouts, and we dap over the table.

“I didn’t know you DJ!” I shout.

“T do now,” and he winks at me.

Jimmy catches up with us.

“Eric, this is my friend Jimmy. Jimmy, this is an old
buddy of mine.” I am delighted to make the introduction.

Jimmy and Eric dap, then Jimmy glares at me.

“Hey, I’ll be back Eric,” I say, then walk away with Jimmy
to an unoccupied corner of the Middle East. He says he wants
to talk outside. I tell him, we’ll have to pay cover again if we
go outside, and then he walks out.

Outside, I say, “Eric’s going to hook us up with the Middle
East for sure.”

Jimmy slowly puts a Spirit to his lips, but doesn’t light
it. Then he pulls it out of his mouth, holds it, and says, “Are
you really that fucking stupid?”

“What are you talking about, he’s going to hook us up!”

“T told you not to play dumb with me.”

“I have no clue what’s going on.”

“You really are that fucking stupid. We need to have a
talk.”

And then Jimmy explains The Powers to me, as we walk
around the neighborhood.
