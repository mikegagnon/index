Superrationality

During my travels I came across Douglas Hofstadter’s formal-
ization of superrationality, and then discovered its relation-
ship to jiu jitsu and trusting trust. But first, I need explain
the traditional notion of “rationality.”

In game theory, a player is “rational” if, and only if, the
player’s actions are optimal towards achieving an objective.
In traditional game theory, rational players never trust other
players. This lack of trust unfortunately leads to problems,
such as cliff dancing.

One of the ways to overcome the problems of traditional
rationality is by employing superrationality. A superrational
player is a trustworthy rational player who can identify super-
rational players, and who trusts other superrational players.
According to legend, jiu jitsu masters are superrational.

Legendary jiu jitsu masters are:

. Honor-bound
. Fearless

. Skillful

2.

4. Determined
5. Peaceful

6

. Always ready to sacrifice themselves for the greater good

All jiu jitsu masters deterministically follow the exact same
code of conduct. You could say, they all “run the same pro-
gram.”

A key to the success of jiu jitsu is superrationality. It is
therefore important for jiu jitsu masters to be able to reli-
ably identify each other, so they can take advantage of super-
rational strategies. Jiu jitsu masters use the “Introduction
Protocol” to identify each other.
