To wit, jiu jitsu masters loudly announce that they are jiu
jitsu masters. But, so do liars and people with delusions of
grandeur. Jiu jitsu masters prove to each other that they are
jiu jitsu masters by behaving in ways that are very difficult for
non-masters to behave. It is essentially an interactive proof
system.

Jimmy says: “You do know jiu jitsu.”

I say: “No, it’s just a metaphor. We need to go beer-
garden hopping tonight, and I’m going to use superrationality
to find a doorman to accept our deal. The program I’m going
to run may appear chaotic, but it’s going to be necessary to
authenticate myself, since although our doorman is probably
expecting us, our doorman won’t know who I am.”
