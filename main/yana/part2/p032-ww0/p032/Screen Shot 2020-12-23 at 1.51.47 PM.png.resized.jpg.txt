World War 0

Jimmy explains the following. Ever since globalization, when-
ever a new technology creates a new domain of warfare, there’s
a fresh power vacuum, and a new world war erupts. World
War 1 was the fight for the sea, and the advent of shooting
bombs from underwater. World War 2, was the fight for the
air, and the advent of dropping atomic bombs from the air.
World War 3, the cold war, was the fight for space, and the ad-
vent of dropping atomic bombs from space. World War 4 was
the fight for cyberspace, and the advent of cyber-kinetic nu-
clear warfare. Finally, World War 5 is the fight for mindspace.
WWS5 is our current war. It is the final war, the real war to
end all wars. And, since we’ve been fighting WW5 the entire
time, we may as well call it World War 0.

And then Jimmy says: “To end WWO, we must balance
The Powers. Your game with BMD proved to everyone that
cyberpower owns land, sea, air, and space. You’re America’s
MVP from WW4, you're a legend, and, honestly, I’m sur-
prised we’ve actually met in the flesh. Don’t smile you fuck,
there’s blood on your hands and I’m MVP ISIS. The war in
cyberspace is a war of mutually assured destruction. If we
start defacing pages, then everyone else is going to do that
too, it’s going to be unpredictable chaos in mindspace, and
everyone’s probably going to die because shit’s going to esca-
late and when God-knows-who starts to feel like their ideology
is about to die, they’re going to start shooting off everyone
else’s nukes. Cyber operations are against the rules of en-
gagement for WWO, so think of a cyberless bottom-up plan,
you fucking idiot genius.”
