Preface

Four years ago, I began trying to tell the story of the preceding
two years of my life. After multiple failed attempts, I feel I
have finally succeeded by writing this present volume—which
I’m calling a metaphorical memoir.

Whenever I attempted nonfiction, it always turned into a
jumbled mess that I wouldn’t dare share. I don’t even remem-
ber everything that happened, much less can I make complete
sense of the memories I’ve retained. Therefore, in writing this
book, I have re-ordered events, changed details, made things
up, and tied things together into a cohesive story that actually
makes sense.

With this story, I am trying to convey a sense of my ex-
perience. The parts of the story that I have made up do not
really embellish things much. Rather, the fiction contained
herein stands as a metaphor for what I actually experienced.
It’s fiction; it’s nonfiction. Think of it like a movie that begins
with, “Based on a true story.”
