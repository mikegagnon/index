to show up at my doorstep?” He says, “You’re the only one
who can help. I’ve cracked a message that’s going to change
everything.”

It turns out Becky’s a hacker too. He asks her to broad-
cast his decoded message to Earth’s Jumbotron, and she re-
luctantly agrees.

Cut to a Grey voice, broadcasting across all the world’s
TVs: “We would like to share our technology with you, but
we're afraid you'll use it against us. Prove to us you are ready
for world peace, by this upcoming full moon, or you will lose
the opportunity for peace, forever. We’re not the evil beings
you think we are. Discover and disclose the Grey Secret.”

Cut to the man and Becky. The man asks: “Do you think
this will work?” Becky silently nods.

Cut to peaceful world-peace demonstrations all over Earth,
under a full moon. The scenes last for several minutes. Fade
to black. Two hashtags pop up on the screen: #GreySecret
#Disclosure. Roll credits.
