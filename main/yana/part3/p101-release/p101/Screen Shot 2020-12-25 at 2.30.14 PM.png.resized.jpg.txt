Release
December 23, 2015

After a few days of my “sanity” charade, they release me.
I organize my belongings in my backpacking pack, don my
monk’s robes, and step outside the perimeter of the prison,
through the gate, to freedom.

My father is waiting for me, and his eyes grow wide when
he sees me. He runs up to the front desk, and says to the
receptionist: “My son’s not ready to be released. Look, he’s
wearing his monk’s robes! He’s still delusional!” The recep-
tionist is unsympathetic. My father insists to see the psy-
chiatrist, but the receptionist says that’s not possible, then
my father demands, one thing leads to another, my father is
screaming at the receptionist, and she threatens to call the
police.

My father screams: “This is horse shit!” and the police
show up. He’s yelling at everyone, including the police, and
the police explain there’s nothing they can do. Finally, he
exits the building with me. He’s frowning, but I’m smiling,
because I love that I’m free and my father is powerless to have
me locked up.

We go to a diner for a silent, early breakfast. I’m listening
for messages from The Powers on the TV, but I all hear is
static idle chatter. I text Jimmy, asking about the Spirits and
the Iran Nuclear Deal. I offer to pay for breakfast, but my
father treats.
