Psych Ward

Around 11pm, December 24, 2015

My father’s in the psych ward with me. I break the silence
by saying: “Let me tell you about the World Peace.” And I
spend the next 10 minutes, summing up everything for him.
He listens, and asks relevant, clarifying questions.

Then, I say: “I need you to post the Grey Secret on my
blog. It’s the keystone for friendship between ISIS and USA
and the Galaxy. And I’m afraid if we don’t air the Grey Secret
right now, we’re going to lose the World Peace forever.”

“Tell me the Grey Secret.”

Then, I write it out for him on a piece of paper.
