AgentX YZ

Have we reached critical mass? Does one third of Earth sup-
port me, consciously or subliminally? I decide to formally
organize my army; I announce the formation of AgentXYZ
on my blog:

I am starting a new for-profit intelligence corpo-
ration. It’s a 50-50 deal: I get half the profit,
employees get half the profit.

We offer Agents-For-Rent #AFR. Our agents are
elite-jiu-jitsu-hacker operatives who are here to
help you. Call 555-555-5555, any time and some-
one will immediately answer: “Operator.”

If you sign up, we will become your new interface
to Earth, so you can achieve a significant force
multiplier.

We offer agents specializing in field work such as
espionage, body protection, body sybils, doormen,
bouncers, etc.

I’m just about to disclose Grey Secret to Earth, via my
blog, but suddenly my computer freezes, and a large message
pops up, saying: “Cool off.”
