Overcoming the Confirmation Bias

 

If you want to be scientific about your beliefs, you must sub-
ject your beliefs to skepticism. Seek out and consider evidence
that contradicts your beliefs. It is another basic hallmark of
science. For example, if you believe you are not mistaken,
you should seek out and consider evidence that suggests you
are mistaken.
