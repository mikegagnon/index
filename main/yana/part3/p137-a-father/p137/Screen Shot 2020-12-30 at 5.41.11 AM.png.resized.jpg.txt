Father

“Tharpa, I can’t post the Grey Secret to your blog.”

“Why not?”

“T would lose my security clearance, I would lose my job,
I would lose my career.”

“Dad. The World Peace is more important than all those
things.”

“I’m not sure posting it would deliver the World Peace.”

“Look at it this way. If you don’t post it, and there’s no
world peace tomorrow, then I won’t know whether or not I’m
delusional. But if you post it, and there’s no world peace
tomorrow, I’ll know I was being delusional.”

He thinks for a few minutes, then says, “I’ll post it.”

“Hurry, go now! It needs to be in before midnight!”

My father runs out of the psych ward.
