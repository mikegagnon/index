Bank of America

Around 3 pm, December 24, 2015

An hour and a half later, I’m walking out of a Bank of
America in Denver with about $30,000 in cash. I give $3,000
to Deluxe, saying: “This is for you,” and he cries. I continue:
“I would give you more but we need the rest for the Zen
Banking Algorithm.” He nods, still crying.
