Disclosure

According to Deluxe, “We all want disclosure.” Disclosure is
a giant red pill—a red pill that will wake everyone up to the
truth of E.T. life on Earth, and the conflict of our galaxy.
The believers of Earth have been demanding disclosure ever
since The Powers began concealing our E.T. connection, who
knows how long ago.

According to Deluxe, E.T.’s are all over Earth, our solar
system, and our galaxy. They’ve been monitoring and inter-
fering with our affairs for a long time. There are many species
of E.T.’s including Greys, Pleiadians, Arcturians, Reptilians,
Insectoids, and Sirians, to name a few. For one reason or
another, Earth has become the nexus for the final conflict be-
tween the various intelligent lifeforms of our galaxy. Creating
peace on Earth would bring peace to the whole galaxy.

The Greys are the most technologically advanced species,
and have been using their power to abduct Earth and E.T.
species, for unknown reasons. In contrast, the Pleiadians and
Arcturians seem to be the most spiritually advanced species.
They both claim they are enlightened, and they regularly
broadcast messages to Earth with instructions on how to
become enlightened. However, the instructions for achiev-
ing enlightenment differ between the Pleiadian and Arcturian
broadcasts.

Also, The Powers of Earth have been both fighting and
cooperating with the E.T.’s for several decades, perhaps even
centuries, perhaps even millennia. They’ve also been keep-
ing it a secret from the public. Tens of thousands of people
worldwide are familiar with this intragalactic conflict.

Holy shit. Now it’s clear; The Grey Secret is obvious to
me; I learned it while negotiating with Jimmy about a year
ago, and I now see how it’s necessary to disclose this secret
