Message to NSA

December 24, 2015

I wake up to birds chirping, and I am so happy to be in
a warm sleeping bag. I step outside the tent, and Deluxe is
there, waiting with a fresh thermos of coffee. I thank him,
and he requests a teaching.

I say, “I’ll teach you how to send messages to NSA.”

He looks around. “Are you crazy?” he whispers.

“Grab your laptop,” I say, and he hurries into the tent,
fumbles around the interior chaos, then eventually comes up
with his laptop. We walk over to a picnic table and we have
a seat.

“Open up your favorite text editor, just not Emacs, and
type in: ‘We want open borders, global basic income, and red
pills.’ Then save it. That’s all!”

Confused, he says: “But how do we send it to them?”

Ireply: “NSA knows you’re with me, NSA is power surveilling
me, and now NSA is power surveilling you.” Then, I explain
Snowden, The Powers, WWO, and The Iran Nuclear Deal. I
leave out the parts about ISIS.

I finish by saying: “We can only achieve security through
insecurity; we must let The Powers observe us and interfere
with us, because it makes them feel safe, and if they feel safe,
nukes are less likely to go off. Our only hope is to play by
their rules, and achieve the World Peace on their terms. Now
that you’re with me, you can no longer operate the Low Orbit
Ion Cannon; it’s against the rules of engagement. Sorry, but
at least you’ve escaped a matrix.”
