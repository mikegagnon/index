Coloring

Over the previous twelve months, I discovered that the quick-
est way to escape a psych ward is through the fire escape.
But, if you go that route, then the police go after you, and
life becomes more annoying than it needs to be.

It took me a while to figure out that the best way to
escape a psych ward is to spend a few days pretending the
sedatives are working, and behaving in a manner consistent
with psychiatry’s insane notion of sanity. Said behavior limits
the opportunity to socialize with other prisoners.

Thus, when Marco approached me, and said, “Hi, I’m
Marco,” while I was coloring a unicorn in a coloring book, I
ignored him. Coloring is long, tedious work, but psychiatrists
like to see coloring, so I colored.

Yes, I’m looking to rendezvous with secret agents. I don’t
know who, yet, but I’m hoping The Powers will send me at
least one, so I can reengage my mission for the World Peace.
But, if The Powers want me to meet a secret agent, it’s going
to need to be outside the psych ward. Those are my terms.
