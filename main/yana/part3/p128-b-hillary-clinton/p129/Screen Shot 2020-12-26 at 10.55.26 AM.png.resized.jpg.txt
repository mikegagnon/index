If shit doesnâ€™t start happening faster, I will launch
a social movement to have my Uncle Steve elected
for President, instead of Hillary Clinton.

A few minutes later, the #1 spot on Google News points to
an article about how the billionaire top-donor to Jeb Bush,
moments ago, switched allegiance to the democrats, and is
now funding Hillary Clinton. Apparently, The Powers would
rather double down on Hilary Clinton, than have my Uncle
Steve assume the presidency. This is amazing. How powerful
am I?
