Prologue to Part III

Mahatma Gandhi referred to the Hindu epic The Bhagavad
Gita as his “spiritual dictionary.” Gita tells the story of Arjun,
a warrior, from a warrior family, who is about to embark
upon an epic battle. Suddenly, he realizes we’re all one, and
everyone is his family, including the so-called enemy. Thus, he
makes plans to inform everyone about the situation, so that
we can all cease fire, since we’re all family. But, his charioteer
reveals himself to be Krishna, a god, perhaps the God, and
Krishna tells Arjun: “You must shoot the enemy.” They have
a long discussion, lasting several hundred pages, and Krishna
finally convinces Arjun to fulfill his duty and shoot the enemy.

Scholars and adherents are divided on whether or not it’s
a metaphor. But, Mahatma Gandhi did recruit Indians to
join the British forces during World War 1.
