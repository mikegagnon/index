AgentX YZ Commercial

In the commercial, a bald man gives a tour of his new startup
office space, saying:

Do you ever choke up when you’re trying to hit
on a beautiful woman? Hey, it happens. That’s
why you need a guy like me around. I’m Phil
Brock, and I want to be your bald wingman. Bald
Wingman is a new service, whose only mission is
to make you look good. And it’s easy too. Tweet
us your location and we’ll be there in a flash to
make you look more attractive than ever.

It’s a Rogaine commercial. I laugh hard; The Powers are
amazing. It’s stunning how quickly they operate. I attach the
commercial to a tweet that requests an AgentX YZ operative:

I’m at #Xeno in Denver. Need a #BaldWingman
#NOW!
