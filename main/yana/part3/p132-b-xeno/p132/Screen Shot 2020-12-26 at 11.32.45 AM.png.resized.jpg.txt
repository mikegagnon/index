Xeno

 

One of my favorite thing about strip clubs, is the strippers
will often indulge you in conversation, when you pay for lap
dances. I am in the mood to talk, so I take a taxi to Denver’s
purportedly greatest strip club, Xeno.

The club is quite posh, and there are many strippers, door-
men, bouncers, bar tenders, and patrons. I start off the night
by tipping each employee in the club a fresh hundred dollar
bill, then I order a tulip of Louis XIII cognac.

I sign up for several lap dances, and tell everyone who’s
interested all about what I’m up to today. Receiving many
intelligent questions feels great. It’s a relief to talk in the
open, about something that’s been so secret for such a long
time.

After my fourth lap dance, I take a break and check my
phone. I scroll down my Twitter feed, laughing at how The
Powers are manifesting my wishes into reality. In particular,
there’s a commercial for AgentX YZ.
