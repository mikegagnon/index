The Alley

There’s an alley downtown, behind a hipster coffee shop,
where vagabonds tend to hang out. I enter the alley. There’s
a few people sitting on the curb, and it looks like they’re
sharing a joint.

“May I join?” I ask.

“Please,” one of them says, and hands me the joint. I

it is sometimes powerful enough to take down websites. It
seems he’s an earnest neophyte, who is either: (a) playing
with fire, and on his way to prison, or (b) suffering from delu-

Powers. No, he’s definitely not a secret agent. If actors were
this good, they’d have to hand out antipsychotics at movie
theaters.

“He’s our #1 hacker,” someone from the group says, and
