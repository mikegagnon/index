they smile.

The hacker looks at me, and asks: “Do you hack?”

“Yes.”

“What do you hack?”

“Everything. I’m Earth’s #1 hacker.”

Of course, they present a show that they don’t believe me.
Eventually, I get around to explaining how high-density cy-
berbombs put the Low Orbit Ion Cannon to shame. I explain
how I conquered ballistic missile defense, then show them my
BMD coin. Deluxe’s eyes grow wide, but everyone else still
says I’m full of shit.

I shrug, and say: “Super Hacker Deluxe, if you ever want
to level up, I can teach you. I gotta run right now though; I
need to find some food and a Bank of America. Thank you
so much for the smoke.” I stand up, and walk away.
