Rosabella’s Home

One thing leads to another, and I pour kombucha on top of
my father’s head. I’m trying to demonstrate to him that he is
responsible for his own emotions; it’s up to him; and he can’t
blame me for his own anger.

He calls the police, to report an assault and requests a
mental-health worker authorized to take people away to psych
wards. The police come, without a mental-health worker, and
when they arrive I’ve already changed out of my monk’s robes
and into my denim-on-denim streetwear suit underneath a ski
jacket and ski pants. My backpack is next to me, and I’m
ready for anything.

The police interview my father. He is hysterical and de-
mands a mental-health worker. I calmly explain to the police
officers that my father suffers from an anger problem, and
please don’t take him away, he’ll be fine soon. The police
give me a citation for harassment, then Rosabella kicks me
out of her home, telling me: “You can’t disrespect your father
like that in my home. If you come back, I’ll call the police
for trespassing.” So, now I’m outside in the snow, and I reach
into my pocket, so I can call an Uber to my favorite hotel in
downtown.
