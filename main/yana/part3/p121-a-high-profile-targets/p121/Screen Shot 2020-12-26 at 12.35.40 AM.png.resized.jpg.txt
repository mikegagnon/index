High-Profile Targets

Ineed to enlighten Hacker News—the news website for Earth’s
most elite hackers. I create a new blog on Medium.com, create
the following blog post, and submit it to Hacker News:

We need to achieve the World Peace tonight, or
we will lose the opportunity forever. After every
world war, there is peace where everyone becomes
friends, once again. In this case, we need to be-
come friends with ISIS. Tonight. If it helps, you
should know that I’m ISIS. Don’t you love me?
The Red Bull Grey Secret Disclosure film pretty
much says it all. I will prove my case shortly, on
this blog.

Deluxe shouts, “A buddy says he can target E.T.’s on
Facebook adverting for $1,000!”

I reply: “Ask him to write a one-page essay explaining
how.”

Deluxe replies: “Roger.”
