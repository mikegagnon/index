Venezuela

Sandy, one of my Facebook friends sees my activity, and hits
me up. She says: “Hey there! How are you? Looks like you’re
real busy hacking the planet. Could you hack Venezuelan
government websites for me?” She explains why, and who she
wants in power. So, I tweet:

In Venezuela elections, happening now, the cor-
rupt PSUV needs to go down!!! The MUD Unidad
party needs to win!!!

I check the news a few minutes later, and the Unidad MUD
party just won Venezuela’s elections. How powerful am I?
