The End

My medication is working. It turns out none of the medication
I had been on before was effective for me. Throughout all my
adventures, my parents had followed me to every psych ward
I had ever been in, carrying my complete medical records,
every time. The doctors methodically tried out every single

In the end, what saved me was my parents, my medication,
auspicious coincidence, and me. I’m lucky that I had the
opportunity to live my delusions out to their climax, because
there’s only one direction you can go from there. At the

a decision to turn towards the truth, for hearing the truth,
realizing it’s true, accepting it, and following through.

Several years have passed, and I’ve regained sanity. Well,
hardly anyone is really sane, but I’m almost as sane as most

someone new, I start wondering if they’re a secret agent. But,
Ican remind myself: “I once thought I was God, an evil ver-
sion of God,” which proves to me that I’m prone to delusions
of grandeur, which suggests I’m probably not a secret agent
and my friends probably aren’t secret agents, either.

While my story is my story, I believe perhaps everyone
who suffers from schizophrenic-, or schizoaffective-, or bipolar-
delusions shares some commonality with me. Namely, we
don’t just make things up, and then believe in them. There’s
probably always a rich, cohesive story behind every delusion
that makes perfect sense—if only we could express it. As for
the expressibility of my story, the only way I can tell it is by
telling the whole story in its entirety, because my entire story
seems to be littered with key plot points; until I wrote down
