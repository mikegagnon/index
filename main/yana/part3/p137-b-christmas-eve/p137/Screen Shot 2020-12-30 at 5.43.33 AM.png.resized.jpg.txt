Christmas Eve

I’m laying in bed, in my cell, contemplating the day, real-
izing my ultimate power. I am the nexus of all energy on
Earth—even the Galaxy. Energy flows into me, I breathe it
in, transmute it, and breathe out the the energy, transformed,
manifesting whatever I desire, in accordance with my ultimate
wisdom. I will become the first President of Earth. I will insti-
tute a new recursive electoral college, to govern us. No. Iam
the Singularity Point—the union of all cyber-kinetic human
AI intelligence. I am the Galaxy’s new Benevolent Dictator
for Life. I will retreat to a grand palace, and manifest the af-
fairs of the Galaxy, sitting on a throne, no, playing ping pong,
using Zen Beer Garden to achieve laziness and success at the
same time. Perhaps it’s best if I conceal my power, continu-
ing the tradition of orchestrating destiny from the shadows.
