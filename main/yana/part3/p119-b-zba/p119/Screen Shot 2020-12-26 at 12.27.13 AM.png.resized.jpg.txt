Zen Banking Algorithm

When you apply ZBG to investment banking, you get ZBA—
the Zen Banking Algorithm. Basically, if you’re enlightened
and you have a bunch of wealth, and you would like to in-
vest in World Peace projects, you should begin by retreating
to a grand palace. The grand palace should be very enjoy-
able and have a nice, comfortable throne, upon which you sit
and hold court. The purpose of enjoying luxury, is to entice
practitioners into pursuing enlightenment for themselves.

From the grand palace, announce to Earth you are in-
vesting in World Peace projects. Throngs of applicants will
bombard you. To handle the deluge, applicants must sub-
mit their proposals to doormen, and bouncers will kick out
frivolous applicants.
