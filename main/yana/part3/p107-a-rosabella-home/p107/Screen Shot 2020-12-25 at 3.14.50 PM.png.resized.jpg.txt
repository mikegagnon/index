Rosabella’s Home

Rosabella says: “Padre, does that make sense?”

My father says: “It’s delusional gibberish.”

Then, I say: “It’s not delusional gibberish. What Ros-
abella is trying to say, is if you want to stand a chance to-
wards influencing my decision making, you need to let me
indoctrinate you, then you can attempt to use my own logic
against me.”

“You are delusional. You don’t have a Ph.D. dissertation
and you know it.”
