Proof

 

Itâ€™s time to prove to the world that the Greys are real, and
they, along with ISIS, want peace, and I am their diplomat,
and we must become friends tonight. I post an essay that
discusses the confirmation bias, overcoming the confirmation
bias, Yamba, paradigms, and how there are some truths that
can only be discovered by believing before seeing. Then I
conclude by saying:

If you follow my blog while consciously choosing to
believe my blog, then you will see the truth within
my blog. It may be your only hope for seeing the
truth, saving Earth, and saving the Galaxy.
