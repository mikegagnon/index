Yamba
Yamba is the name of my idiolect. According to Wikipedia:

In linguistics, an idiolect is an individual’s distinc-
tive and unique use of language, including speech.
The unique usage encompasses vocabulary, gram-
mar, and pronunciation. Idiolect is the variety of
language unique to an individual.

In other words, I don’t actually speak English. Rather,
I speak my own language. When I use a word, its meaning
may be different than what you think I’m trying to express.

Every human uses a language unique to the individual,
as part of an ongoing effort to communicate the speaker’s
thought bubbles to other humans. A human’s idiolect is their
language that is unique to them.

While this essay appears to be written in English, it is
actually written in Yamba. Sentences in Yamba point to
thought bubbles in my brain, and if you misinterpret Yamba
then you will not see the thought bubbles in my brain.

In Yamba, the word “dissertation” refers to “an essay
(long, short, or anything in between) written to be submit-
ted, or already submitted, towards receiving a Ph.D. degree.”
