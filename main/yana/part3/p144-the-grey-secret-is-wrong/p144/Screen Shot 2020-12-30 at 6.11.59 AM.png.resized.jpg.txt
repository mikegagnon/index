The Grey Secret is Wrong

I reject my essay on the Grey Secret, on the grounds that the
essay espouses a simplistic, naive understanding of utilitarian
ethics. To be clear: I claim that a more sophisticated under-
standing of utilitarian ethics reveals that violence, in general,
is almost always unethical.

The reason we should be peaceful, isn’t because it’s “good.”
It’s because peace is almost always the winning strategy for
achieving peace. When you tune into the patterns of the
universe, it’s right there. But to see these patterns, the pos-
sibilities for peace, you probably need to go through a lot of
training. The training isn’t so much a mechanism for intro-
ducing new concepts and ideas into your brain; rather, the
principal purpose of training is to unwind your current pro-
gramming, which takes effort and time.

And, if you don’t believe me, please consider that it just
might be the case that the only way for you to see the truth
of peace, is to train your own mind and see what happens. I
believe it’s a worthy experiment, and the World Peace is on
the line.
