Thoerem and Proof

Theorem: there are some truths that can only be discovered
by “believing before seeing.”

Proof: first, keep in mind that the theorem is expressed
in Yamba and not English. Therefore, there is a significant
danger that you will misinterpret the theorem. Second, your
instincts may suggest, shout, or scream to you that the theo-
rem is false, and that this proof is invalid. If that is the case,
and if you are scientifically minded, then you must seek evi-
dence that the theorem is true and the proof is sound. Third,
if it happens to be the case that the theorem is true, then it
is entirely possible that the theorem represents a truth that
you must believe before you can see how it is true. Fourth, I
claim that the theorem represents one such truth. Le., I claim
that the only way for you to see the truth of the theorem, is
to adopt the belief that the theorem is true.
