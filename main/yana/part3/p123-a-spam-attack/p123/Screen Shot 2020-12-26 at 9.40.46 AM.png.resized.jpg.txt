Spam Attack

I Facebook message a bunch of other mutual friends between
Lena and me, saying: “SOS. Emergency, please ask Lena to
watch me on Twitter,” then I get back to work.

Deluxe shouts: “Zendo, I’m getting slammed. I need your
help.”

“Listen, you’re my doorman, and you remember how ZBG
works, right?”

“Right.”

“We’re probably under a spam attack, right now. Hope-
fully it’s just some rogue hacker who is using a ton of fake
accounts to slam your inbox. But if it’s The Powers, we’re
powerless. For every request you receive, respond with an un-
solved sudoku puzzle. You should only review proposals that
have an attached, hand-written sudoku solution.”

“Roger.”
