Enlightenment

December 18, 2015

About twelve months have passed since I submitted a few
pieces of paper to someone who claimed to be Secret Service.
According to the news, Iran and the US have both signed a
nuclear deal, but it’s unclear when it will go into effect.

I find myself sitting on a meditation cushion, in a large
tent with about sixty other people, two weeks into a four-
week intensive meditation retreat in southeastern Colorado.
My mind pops, and I’m enlightened, yet again.
