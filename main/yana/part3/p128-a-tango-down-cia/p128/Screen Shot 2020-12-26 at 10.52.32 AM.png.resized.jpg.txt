Tango Down CIA

Deluxe shouts: “Tango down, CIA”

“WHAT!?” I shout.

Deluxe is wiping away tears. “I’m a real hacker,” he says
to himself.

“What did you do!?”

“Anonymous just defaced the CIA.gov website, with a
message from the Pleiadian High Council!”

“You idiot! I told you criminal activities were off the ta-
ble.”

“I thought you said ‘under the table!”

I go to CIA.gov, and see a web page from the Council. It
has all the markings off a genuine Council broadcast. Pleia-
dian broadcasts tend to be verbose, but the heart of the mes-
sage says: “To understand ISIS you need to understand the
Grey Secret. We must have world peace tonight, or we’ll lose
the opportunity forever,” and then it links to the Grey Secret
Disclosure video on YouTube.
