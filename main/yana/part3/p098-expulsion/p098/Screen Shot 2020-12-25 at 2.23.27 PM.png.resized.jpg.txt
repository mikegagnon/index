Expulsion

At the retreat, I informed my meditation instructor that I’m
enlightened. She told me, no you’re not enlightened, it’s just
a nyam, a temporary experience, a brief glimpse of enlight-
enment that will go away soon. I said, OK, fine, sure, I’m
“temporarily” enlightened, so you better rush me to the pul-
pit and let me expound upon the teachings of the Buddha,
before it goes away. She said no, I insisted, then I demanded,
one thing led to another, and now I’m in a psych ward, yet
again.
