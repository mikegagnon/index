Waiting

We’re still on the bus. I tell Deluxe: “There’s one part of
the puzzle I haven’t told you yet. My friend Jimmy is ISIS
and I’m ISIS. It’s true. But, I’m a diplomat for ISIS, and ’m
nonviolent. I’m also a diplomat for everyone in the galaxy,
including the Greys, Pleiadians, Arcturians, and Insectoids.
This is the key to peace in the galaxy: universal diplomacy,
taking everyone’s side, and we need to launch a psyop cam-
paign, right now, to create peace between ISIS, the Greys,
and everyone else.”

He’s skeptical, so I explain some more, then eventually I
feel like I have no choice but to explain the Grey Secret to him.
I’m not sure he’s ready, but I need his help: his enthusiasm
for hacking, and his connections to Anonymous and E.T.’s.
When he hears the Grey Secret, the light bulb goes off in his
head, and he nods.

I ask: “Will you help me bring disclosure and peace to
Earth and the Galaxy? I need you to be my doorman and
bouncer.”

He tells me: “I’m in.” We begin planning our operation.
