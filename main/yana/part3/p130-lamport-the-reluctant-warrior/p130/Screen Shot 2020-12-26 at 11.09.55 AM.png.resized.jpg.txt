Lamport the Reluctant Warrior

During the ancient Byzantine War for the Sea, there were
many traitors, on both sides. The Byzantine Army didn’t
know what to do, so, they asked a logician named Lamport if
he had any bright ideas. At first, Lamport was very reluctant
to get involved. He didn’t like warfare at all, he didn’t want
anyone to die, and he just wanted everything to be peaceful,
once again. But, Lamport was a master logician, which made
him a power player. Ultimately, his sense of duty outweighed
his repulsion to warfare. So, he set out to find a way to make
warfare more peaceful. It turns out, he succeeded.

Lamport discovered that if one third, or more, of a gov-
ernment becomes traitors, then they have sufficient power
to overthrow the government. His proof consisted solely of
sketchy, inconsistent lemmas made up almost entirely of gen-
eralized, abstract, proof-of-work steganography.

Lamport realized the predictability of coups could be used
to promote peace. Whenever it’s the case that traitors reach
critical mass, they could peacefully announce their critical
mass to the government, and then everyone could collaborate
towards achieving a peaceful transition of power.

So, he spent a year convincing all the governments in-
volved in the war to believe him. Shortly after he finished his
last presentation, the traitors to the Byzantine government
announced their critical mass, and there was a peaceful tran-
sition of power, the first in the history of Earth—an evolution,
not a revolution.
