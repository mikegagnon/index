Pleiadian High Council

After we request proof, a Twitter account for the Pleiadian
High Council posts a tweet saying: “Awaiting a message from
Anonymous.”

I say to Deluxe: “Pay the doorman to the Council $5k.
Give them a link to my blog, and deliver the following message
to the Council: ‘We are the Greys, the Insectoids, ISIS, and
everyone else. We come in peace. We must become friends
tonight, or we will lose the opportunity forever. We need
you to mobilize a pro-peace, pro-Grey, pro-ISIS social media
campaign across Earth, promoting Grey Secret Disclosure.”
