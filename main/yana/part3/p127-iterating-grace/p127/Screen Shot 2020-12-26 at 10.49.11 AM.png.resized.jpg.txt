Iterating Grace

Deluxe shouts: “Anonymous is #1 on Hacker News!” I click
through to a Washington Post story, published on December
2nd, the same day Grey Secret Disclosure was posted. The
Washington Post story is about a book authored by Anony-
mous, called Iterating Grace. The book tells the story of
a great hacker who becomes disillusioned with Silicon Val-
ley, quits work to fix his soul, and is ultimately trampled to
death by llamas. In Buddhism, death is often a metaphor
for enlightenment, and here llamas are clearly a metaphor for
lamas—reincarnate Buddhist teachers.

I quickly find a PDF of the book, and read it. It’s clearly
about me. Plus, the Grey Secret is embedded within obvious
metaphors inside the story. Plus, the conversation on Hacker
News is primarily a debate about the Grey Secret. Plus, the
Washington Post article ends with: “When it comes to any
sort of stunt that gets a lot of attention on social media, all
roads lead back to Red Bull.”

I’m already the #1 story on Hacker News. This campaign
is working! And holy shit, the Washington Post is in on it.
