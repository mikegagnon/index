<br />
After the events that were portrayed in the book Peter and<br />
Wendy, Tinkerbell and Peter Pan both grew up and got mar-<br />
ried. To each other. Because they grew up, they both forgot<br />
how to fly and their marriage was miserable.<br />
<br />
So, Pan the Man ran away to live in the mountains of<br />
Colorado. All he did there was just play games and go on<br />
adventures. Only very nearly did he escape death on several<br />
occasions. Whenever he wanted a place to stay, he discovered<br />
he could win his keep by doing the dishes cheerfully.<br />
<br />
Pan the Man loved Colorado so much, he spent most of<br />
his time outside Colorado, begging his friends to grown down,<br />
come in, and play. The chief problem Pan was up against in<br />
telling his friends about Colorado, was that everyone thought<br />
he was crazy. Well not everyone thought he was crazy; the<br />
prisoners in the insane asylums loved him.<br />
<br />
Pan had such trouble because he didn&rsquo;t realize that people<br />
actually, truly, did believe him. The problem wasn&rsquo;t disbelief.<br />
Rather, people were just too afraid to visit Colorado with Pan.<br />
<br />
So, it took a long time for everyone to muster up the<br />
courage to visit Colorado. But eventually everyone did. Ex-<br />
cept of course, Tinkerbell. She was still mad at Pan for run-<br />
ning away in the first place. And also, for stealing flowers<br />
from witches.<br />
<br />
To Tinkerbell, Pan would say things like: but look what<br />
T&rsquo;ve found; come on, let&rsquo;s go; you&rsquo;re being an idiot.<br />
<br />
Tinkerbell couldn&rsquo;t help but be extremely stubborn. &ldquo;Come<br />
on Tink! Will you marry me again? I&rsquo;ll make you my princess!<br />
No, I&rsquo;ll make you my queen! Let me do the dishes. Here, let&rsquo;s<br />
play with some fairy dust. Do you like the flowers I got you?<br />
I stole them from a witch! Let me teach you how to fly. I'll<br />
be your happy thought. It&rsquo;s so simple, children can even fly!&rdquo;<br />
<br />
And just then, Tinkerbell suddenly remembered her child-<br />
hood fun in Neverland. She immediately started floating, gig-<br />
