Psych ward

December 20, 2015

My father is here; he flew all the way to Colorado, just
to see me in the psych ward. They called him, because I
foolishly listed my parents as my emergency contacts on my
insurance.

He says: “Don’t you remember being depressed? Do you
remember that you accepted the fact that you have schizoaf-
fective disorder?”

I say: “First of all, it’s an opinion and not a fact. And,
maybe I do have schizoaffective ‘disorder,’ and maybe the
Buddha and Trungpa Rinpoche had it too. Maybe, only peo-
ple with schizoaffective ‘disorder’ are capable of enlighten-
ment. I’m not saying that’s necessarily true, but perhaps it’s
a possibility.”

He says: “You’re only thinking these thoughts right now
because you’re manic. Remember...”

I slam my fist on the table, and shout: “I am not manic!
I am enlightened!”

My father watches the “nurses” take me away. Inside a
windowless room, they strap me to a table. I resolve never
again to be strapped to a table.
