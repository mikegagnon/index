Christmas Day

My father and I watch Fox News all day, from inside the
psych ward. A new cease fire with ISIS has just gone into
effect. There’s footage of ISIS soldiers cheering from pickup
trucks, as they exit a city in a caravan.

We have the World Peace! I am jubilant, but my father
remains silent. I’m dancing and shaking hands with everyone,
saying, “Hi, hello, I’m ISIS, we have the World Peace.”

After a while, he asks about Arjun and the Bhagavad Gita,
and I tell him all about it. He says, “You know, I really doubt
that ISIS is fighting for the side of beneficial outcome.”

“Was fighting,” I correct him.

He says: “Can I try to prove to you that ISIS doesn’t
represent beneficial outcome?”

Smiling, I say, “No, because you'll just fail in that effort.”

He says: “Shouldn’t you try to overcome the confirmation
bias?”

I say: “Ha, no! Overcoming the confirmation bias is for
people who don’t know the truth. Look at the TV, look it’s
the World Peace!”
