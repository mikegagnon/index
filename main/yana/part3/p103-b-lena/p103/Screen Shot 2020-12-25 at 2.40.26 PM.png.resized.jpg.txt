Lena

 

Now that I am enlightened, and unencumbered by the nego-
tiations for the Iran Nuclear Deal, it’s time to win back Lena.
I text Lena, saying: “I’m enlightened now, and would make
a very good husband this time around. Will you marry me
again?”

Then, I attach a short story I’d already written, titled:
Pan and Tinkerbell.
