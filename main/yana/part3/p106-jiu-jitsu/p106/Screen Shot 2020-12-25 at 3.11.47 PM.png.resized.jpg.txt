Jiu Jitsu

T explain that jiu jitsu is the ancient Japanese art of redirect-
ing energy. I pull out my phone. According to Wikipedia:

Jiu jitsu “is a martial art and a method of close
combat for defeating an armed and armored oppo-
nent in which one uses no weapon or only a short
weapon.

“<Jiu’ can be translated to mean ‘gentle, soft, sup-
ple, flexible, pliable, or yielding.’ ‘Jitsu’ can be
translated to mean ‘art’ or ‘technique’ and rep-
resents manipulating the opponent’s force against
themselves rather than confronting it with one’s
own force.”

In mythology, the legendary jiu-jitsu master represents the
exemplary warrior. Martin Luther King, Jr., Gandhi, Arjun,
Ronin, Luke Skywalker, Neo, Captain America, the list goes
on...

Jiu jitsu is alchemy—the process of turning lead into gold.
According to my Ph.D. dissertation, jiu jitsu is also Zen Beer
Garden. Jiu jitsu is how I negotiated the Iran Nuclear Deal.
I let Jimmy kidnap me, then let him indoctrinate me, then
I used his own logic to create a favorable deal that benefits
everyone.
