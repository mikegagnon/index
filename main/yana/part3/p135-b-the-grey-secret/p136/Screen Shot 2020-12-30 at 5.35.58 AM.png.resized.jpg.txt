atomic bombs dropped in Japan. If the United States didn’t
drop those bombs, then many more American and Japanese
people would have died, in avoidable warfare.

In laboratories, scientists sacrifice lab rats for the benefit
of all. This perspective is utilitarian ethics. The Greys have
been abducting humans and other E.T.’s for legitimate sci-
entific research, and the only reason we object is because we
are the lab rats. If we were to take our ego out of the picture,
and become one with the universe, and view things from a
total perspective, we would of course see alien abductions as
ethical: it’s for the benefit of the Galaxy.

Terrorism kills far fewer people compared to traditional
warfare, therefore it is ethical, so long as the perpetrators
of terrorism are fighting for the side of beneficial outcomes.
And, as it turns out, both ISIS and USA are Arjun fighting for
beneficial outcomes. ISIS just wants God’s law to prevail on
Earth, which is great, and USA wants capitalism and democ-
racy to prevail, which is great. We can all become friends by
ending this war, by creating a new, global, fair, 100% inclu-
sive, federation of nations, that includes “In God we trust,”
in the global constitution, via a democratic vote. Therefore,
we can be friends with ISIS, the same way Japan and USA
became friends after WW2.1
