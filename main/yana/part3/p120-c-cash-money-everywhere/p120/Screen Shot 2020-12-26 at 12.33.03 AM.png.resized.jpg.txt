Cash Money Everywhere

We layout our cash and Red Bulls on the bed, along with
the New York Times, and we take a selfie with it. Deluxe
uploads the picture to his Facebook wall, which is where his
Anonymous and E.T. friends hangout. Then he posts a link to
my explanation of ZBA and explains Grey Secret Disclosure
(GSD)—omitting the actual Grey Secret that I had previ-
ously disclosed to him. Finally, he says on his wall: “Make
a proposal for cash money, telling me how much you want,
and how you will blast our messages on America’s Jumbotron.
‘We'll mail you cash tomorrow.”

His Facebook feeds goes nuts, and I say: “Great. I’m going
after some high-profile targets, solo. Shout out the proposals
to me, as you receive them.”
