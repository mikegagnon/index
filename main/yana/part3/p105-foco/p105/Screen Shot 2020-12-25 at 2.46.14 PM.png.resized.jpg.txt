Fort Collins

We arrive in Fort Collins, and there’s no response from Lena.
Rosabella welcomes my father and me into her home. Tapes-
tries Rosabella had stitched together hang from her walls.
Statues of Buddha, Jesus, Shiva, Krishna, merkabahs, angels,
tortoises, elephants, and lions rest here and there, throughout
her home. Her bookshelves host an eclectic mix of books from
all the world’s religions. The lighting is a few shades brighter
than dim. Her fireplace hosts a half-way-through fire.

“Would you like coffee or tea?” she asks. My father says
no thanks, and I say yes please to coffee. While my father and
Isit in silence, she roasts coffee beans upon an iron skillet over
her gas stove, then grinds the beans, and finishes making the
coffee with a French press. She serves me and herself coffee
in tiny, hot mugs with no handles.

“Mukumbe, tell me about the World Peace,” she says and
giggles. Mukumbe is Rosabella’s nickname for me.

“Tm enlightened.”

“Again?” she responds with a laugh, which makes me
laugh too. She looks to my father, and continues: “What
do you think, Padre?”

“He has schizoaffective disorder. He’s delusional. He’s not
enlightened,” my father says, with his arms crossed.

“Padre, has Mukumbe told you about the jiu jitsu?”

“Yes.”

“But he doesn’t get it,” I chime in.
