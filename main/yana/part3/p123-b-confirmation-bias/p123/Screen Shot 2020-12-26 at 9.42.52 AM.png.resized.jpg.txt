The Confirmation Bias

Humans, generally speaking, prefer the beliefs they currently
hold, regardless if those beliefs are accurate or mistaken. The
preference for your current beliefs results in the confirmation
bias. The confirmation bias is the bad habit of only seeking
and considering evidence that conforms to your beliefs. The
bad news is the confirmation bias is endemic amongst hu-
mans. The good news is that you shouldn’t be embarrassed;
it’s endemic.
