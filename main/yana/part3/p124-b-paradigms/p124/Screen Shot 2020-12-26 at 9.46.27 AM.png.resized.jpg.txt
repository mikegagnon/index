Paradigms

A paradigm is an intensely held belief. Paradigms are things
we “know” as opposed to “believe.” For example, “I know I
exist; it’s obvious and self evident.”

When we look at the history of humanity we find that
paradigms are often mistaken. Humans used to believe the
Earth is flat. Humans used to believe the Sun rotates around
the Earth. Humans used to believe atoms are indivisible par-
ticles. And so on.

So, it is quite ridiculous to assume that a belief is correct
just because it is a current paradigm.
