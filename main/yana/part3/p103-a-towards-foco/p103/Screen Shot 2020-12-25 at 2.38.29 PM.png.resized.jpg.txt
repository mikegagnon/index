Towards Fort Collins

Maybe Rosabella can help my father understand my enlight-
enment. Rosabella understands me, she understands Bud-
dhism, she understands enlightenment, she loves me, and ev-
eryone loves her. She’s a saint.

With sly plot conceived, I have convinced my father to
drive us to Fort Collins. He was reluctant, but I told him:
“There’s only one person in the world who could possibly
talk me out of my ‘delusions,’ and it’s Rosabella.”

We begin driving to Fort Collins. There’s snow every-
where.
