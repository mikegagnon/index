Lesson

I tell Deluxe all about ZBG, open borders, global basic in-
come, the World Peace, absolute reality, red pills, blue pills,
and matrices within matrices, within matrices. Although he’s
a novice amateur, he is an amazing student. He especially
loves open borders, global basic income, and the mechanics
of a QEMU red pill 0-day I’ve been hoarding.

In a brief, articulate and fast-paced monologue, he asks
me to help him wake up to absolute reality. I tell him: I
would love to give you that red pill, but you’re not ready yet.
First, you need to escape from your top-level matrix, where
you're currently residing. You don’t even know about WWO,
yet, my dude.
