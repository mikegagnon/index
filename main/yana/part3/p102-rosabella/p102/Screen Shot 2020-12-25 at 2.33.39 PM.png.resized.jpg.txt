Rosabella

My Twitter contract was worth about $1 million in stock.
I left halfway through the contract, yielding $500k in stock.
Half went to Lena with the divorce, leaving me $250k in stock.
I sold the stock, and had to pay about half in taxes, leaving
me with about $120k in cash. I gave away half, and then spent
half, so now I have about $30k in cash in my bank account,
right now.

Of the $60k I gave away, I gave one third of that to Ros-
abella, in the form of a loan that she didn’t really need to pay
back. Here’s a brief synopsis of our story.

When I was living with my parents, shortly before my
mind popped for the first time, Rosabella gave me a ring.
She told me she had told her friends about my TravelingBud-
dha.org website, and one of them would love to host me in
Fort Collins, for a few days in exchange for Buddhist teach-
ings. Wonderful! Let’s arrange it, and I’ll be over there soon.

I asked her how her restaurant’s renovations were going,
and she said she was at an impasse. She needed $20k to finish
the renovations, but the bank wouldn’t loan her the money. I
laughed, and said: “I’ll loan you the money.” Of course, she
thought I was a penniless vagabond. But, then I explained
how much money I had, and I would love to help her. One
of the main practices of the mahayana is generosity, so by
accepting my loan, she would be helping me greatly on my
path. Thus, she said yes, and I transferred the money to her.

Then, when I became depressed after I submitted the Iran
Nuclear Deal, I called her and asked if her friend was still
willing to host me. She said yes, so I drove to Fort Collins.
On the way, I totaled my van in a blizzard in Pennsylvania.
Unfazed, I rented a car and drove the rest of the way.

When I showed up, she realized I was depressed, so she
took me into her home, instead of her friend’s. I spent months
recuperating under her care. Her home had become my home.
