                      <div style='text-align: left;'>Rosabella<br />
<br />
My Twitter contract was worth about $1 million in stock.<br />
I left halfway through the contract, yielding $500k in stock.<br />
Half went to Lena with the divorce, leaving me $250k in stock.<br />
I sold the stock, and had to pay about half in taxes, leaving<br />
me with about $120k in cash. I gave away half, and then spent<br />
half, so now I have about $30k in cash in my bank account,<br />
right now.<br />
<br />
Of the $60k I gave away, I gave one third of that to Ros-<br />
abella, in the form of a loan that she didn&rsquo;t really need to pay<br />
back. Here&rsquo;s a brief synopsis of our story.<br />
<br />
When I was living with my parents, shortly before my<br />
mind popped for the first time, Rosabella gave me a ring.<br />
She told me she had told her friends about my TravelingBud-<br />
dha.org website, and one of them would love to host me in<br />
Fort Collins, for a few days in exchange for Buddhist teach-<br />
ings. Wonderful! Let&rsquo;s arrange it, and I&rsquo;ll be over there soon.<br />
<br />
I asked her how her restaurant&rsquo;s renovations were going,<br />
and she said she was at an impasse. She needed $20k to finish<br />
the renovations, but the bank wouldn&rsquo;t loan her the money. I<br />
laughed, and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll loan you the money.&rdquo; Of course, she<br />
thought I was a penniless vagabond. But, then I explained<br />
how much money I had, and I would love to help her. One<br />
of the main practices of the mahayana is generosity, so by<br />
accepting my loan, she would be helping me greatly on my<br />
path. Thus, she said yes, and I transferred the money to her.<br />
<br />
Then, when I became depressed after I submitted the Iran<br />
Nuclear Deal, I called her and asked if her friend was still<br />
willing to host me. She said yes, so I drove to Fort Collins.<br />
On the way, I totaled my van in a blizzard in Pennsylvania.<br />
Unfazed, I rented a car and drove the rest of the way.<br />
<br />
When I showed up, she realized I was depressed, so she<br />
took me into her home, instead of her friend&rsquo;s. I spent months<br />
recuperating under her care. Her home had become my home.<br />
