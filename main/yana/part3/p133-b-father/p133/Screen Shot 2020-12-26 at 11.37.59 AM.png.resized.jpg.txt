Father

My father walks through the door, into Xeno, and I’m rolling
on the floor laughing.

“Dad, you’re AgentX YZ. Finally, I am the Lion King!”

“Listen, son, I’m sorry how I haven’t been listening to you.
That’s changing now.”

“Ha! Whatever. I need you to tell me everything about
Area 51.”

“I don’t know anything about Area 51.”

“Liar! Tell me about the Greys!” I shout.
