5th grade

In the fifth grade, I began teaching myself to program in
QBASIC. One of my first pieces of software was a game called
Airstrike. I wrote the following instruction manual:

This game was created by Tharpa Thaye in 1995.
In the game you are a jet fighter pilot. In the last
battle (Level 1), your radar broke. So you will
not know where the enemy is. Your objective is
to get in shooting range (the enemy is in shooting
range if he is 5 meters dead ahead of you) with
the enemy. Then, you must shoot the enemy. You
only get one shot so make it good. If you hit the
enemy you win. If you pass, crash into, you miss
the enemy, or if he hits you, you lose. Good luck!
