The Three Yanas

“.. you might find yourself behaving calmly in the
hinayana, kindly in the mahayana, and then freak-
ing out in the vajrayana.” — Trungpa Rinpoche

After the film, I researched Trungpa Rinpoche to figure
out which of his books I should start with. Of his many
books, I learned that he had written one trilogy in particu-
lar, spanning over 1,500 pages, covering the three yanas: the
hinayana, the mahayana, and the vajrayana.

You begin at the hinayana, which is the the path of liber-
ating yourself from your own suffering.
