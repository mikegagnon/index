Once you’ve sufficiently liberated yourself, the next step is
the mahayana, in which you train to become a bodhisattva—
a saint—someone who dedicates their life to benefiting all
sentient beings.

Finally, once you are sufficiently saintly, you enter the
vajrayana—the secret path of sudden enlightenment. The
only way to enter the vajrayana, it is said, is to find a guru—
an enlightened vajrayana master—who transmits the secret
teachings of Buddhism to you, in person. Trungpa Rinpoche
warned that the vajrayana is dangerous. Specifically, he cau-
tioned that if you enter the vajrayana without the preparation
of the hinayana and mahayana, you would likely go crazy.

So, I bought the trilogy and dove into the hinayana.
