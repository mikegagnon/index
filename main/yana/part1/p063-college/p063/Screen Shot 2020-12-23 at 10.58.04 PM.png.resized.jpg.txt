College

I was accepted to only one college, Virginia Commonwealth
University, and, free from my parents, I made it my mission
to party as hard as possible and drink as much as possible.
Despite succeeding in my mission, I graduated #1 in my class
in 2007, with a degree in computer science.

My undergraduate thesis weighed in on the “red-pill” /
“blue-pill” debate of the time. In hacking, a red pill is a
snippet of software that attempts to determine whether or
not the software is under attack. In contrast, a blue pill is
a snippet of software that attempts to trick red pills into
thinking they’re not under attack, when, in fact, they actually
are under attack. I concluded that red pills have a theoretical
advantage over blue pills, because blue pills introduce timing
anomalies that are fundamentally difficult to hide.

In metaphorical terms, if someone is trying to trick you,
and you're trying to figure out if you’re being tricked, then
you have a fundamental advantage.

The centerpiece of my thesis was a red-pill that measured
the timing effects of “high-density cyberbombs” that only ex-
plode upon contact with blue pills. A prestigious journal pub-
lished a politically correct version of my thesis.
