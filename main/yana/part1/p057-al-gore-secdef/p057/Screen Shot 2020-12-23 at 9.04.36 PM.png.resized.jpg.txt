Al Gore and The SecDef

In one of my father’s last roles in the Air Force, he spent
six months leading the effort to organize the 1996 Defense
Ministerial of the Americas—a conference for the most senior
leaders of the various militaries of North and South America.

This is the story of how he nabbed a picture with Al Gore,
the story of how he intimidated the United State’s Secretary

my father, to request a minor change to the organization of
the conference. This request annoyed my father, but he went

A few minutes later, the SecDef requested another change,
and, annoyed, my father said, “OK,” and so on and so forth,
while my father slowly grew in anger and insult.

Towards the end of the briefing, my father told the SecDef:
everyone would be required to wear to a badge, including the
American VIPs whom everyone would know, such as Vice

badge, and when we deny them, they’ll be insulted.”

The SecDef insisted on giving Al Gore a pass, at which
point my Dad threw his right elbow onto the table in front of
