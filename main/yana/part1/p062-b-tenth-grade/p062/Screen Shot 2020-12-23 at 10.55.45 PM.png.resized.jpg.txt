Tenth grade

In the tenth grade, I won a national programming competi-
tion. The same year, I made a website to protest my school’s
flagship educational program. The school expelled me, and
my parents laced me with punishment—which shocked me,
because I thought my parents believed in the sanctity of jus-
tice and the First Amendment. I sunk into depression and
had to repeat the tenth grade.
