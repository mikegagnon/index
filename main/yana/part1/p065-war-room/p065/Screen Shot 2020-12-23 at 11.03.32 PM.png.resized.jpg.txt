The War Room

A little known fact about MIT, is that MIT’s largest labo-
ratory, Lincoln Laboratory, resides on an Air Force base in
Lexington, Massachusetts, 12 miles northwest of Boston. LL
works almost exclusively for the United States’ Department of
Defense (DoD), performing secret research and development.

After graduating from Mason, I joined LL as an associate
staff member. Among many adventures, I once found myself
playing the red team in a war game. From the podium in the
War Room of the Pentagon, I said “Hit it” and a high-density
cyberbomb knocked out the United States’ ballistic-missile-
defense system.

LL sent me to Dubai to share my hack with the world at
an academic conference specializing in research on surviving
cyber-kinetic nuclear warfare. The trip to Dubai doubled as
my honeymoon with my new wife, Lena.
