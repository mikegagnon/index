So, the three of us lived together. I continually attempted
to mediate their arguments, and when the arguments turned
on me, I took it as an opportunity to practice inner peace.
In Tibetan Buddhism, there’s a legend of a great spiritual
master, who always traveled with an obnoxious, hot-tempered
tea boy. The spiritual master insisted on having the tea boy
around, so that the master could have the opportunity to
practice. Without a challenge, there’s no way to practice.

A few weeks into living with my parents, I had a nice
routine going. My parents had finally accepted my eccentric
Buddhism, perhaps because my practice involved me doing
lots of chores for them.

I was sitting 40 minutes a day, and I had reached a mile-
stone in my meditation practice: I no longer dreaded going
to the cushion; rather, the cushion was starting to feel like
home. Then, one evening, while sitting: my mind popped.
