Northwest Washington D.C.

My anxiety caught up with me once again. I had run out
of spiritual retreat centers in Colorado, so, I retreated to my
parents’ condo in Washington D.C..

My parents were worried about me—my new obsession for
Buddhism, my seemingly reckless adventures, my cannabis
habit, my cigarette habit, and so on. But, Buddhism didn’t
seem soooo bad. My father said something along the lines
of: “No one’s ever heard of a Buddhist bank robber.” Plus,
I took on the responsibility of doing the dishes after every
meal, as part of my hinayana practice, so maybe Buddhism
was having a wholesome influence on me.

But then, I showed my parents the film Crazy Wisdom
and they became afraid that I was joining a religious cult. I
tried to assure them that even if Shambhala is a cult, you
don’t have to worry about it, because they they expelled me.
It didn’t help.
