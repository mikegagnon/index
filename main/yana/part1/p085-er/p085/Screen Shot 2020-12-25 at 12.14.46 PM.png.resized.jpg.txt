Emergency Room

“Decorum is the way to keep your precision, to
keep your sense of dignity, your sense of head
& shoulders... With hinayana decorum, whatever
you do should be done simply... whatever you do
should be done with mindfulness & awareness.” —
Trungpa Rinpoche

I composed myself, and carefully packed all of my belong-
ings with the precision of the hinayana. I walked to the ER
while meditating. When I arrived, I informed the worker at
the front desk that I was experiencing a tremendous amount
of psychosomatic pain.

Eventually, I found myself in a hospital bed, being in-
terviewed by a doctor who didn’t believe it was possible for
someone to absorb someone else’s pain. Plus, he remarked
that I seemed awfully calm for someone who is claiming to
be in a tremendous amount of pain. I offered to display my
pain, and when I did he ran out of the room.

Slowly, the pain dissipated and eventually they discharged
me. The next day I drove to Karmé Chéling—a 700-acre
Shambhala retreat center in rural Vermont—where I expected
to find a genuine, true, actual enlightened society.
