Albuquerque

It was night, and we were driving on a highway towards Albu-
querque, alone on the road. I was gushing to Lena about the
realizations I’d had since I began studying Buddhism—trying
to pull her along with me on my spiritual journey. Excited,
and innocent, I accidentally reminded Lena that we’re not
really married.

Lena erupted, and I found myself floating in my seat. Col-
ors darted and flickered. I was completely at peace, seeing
clearly how Lena’s pain was totally unnecessary. I was one
with the universe, and I could viscerally feel the truth of the
Four Noble Truths. All I wanted was to ease her suffering,
and ease the suffering of everyone else on Earth.

I vowed to dedicate my life to liberating everyone from the
unnecessary suffering of samsara.

The colors and the floating dissipated, but, remembering
the logic of my realization, I tried talking Lena into seeing
the peace I saw, but it didn’t work. She drove our car to the
airport, she got out, and flew to Virginia.
