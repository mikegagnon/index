Towards Virginia

“According to the mahayana, love is entirely with-
out aggression. Love includes accepting others and
being noble, reasonable, openhearted, resourceful,
and free of possessiveness. With love, you are
totally gentle, utterly kind, thorough, wise, fear-
less, and willing to commit yourself to any situ-
ation. You are warriorlike, industrious, tireless,
and never take time off for yourself. When you
need to give your help to others, you are always
willing to do so.” — Trungpa Rinpoche

“If you are a practitioner of the buddhadharma
[Buddhist teachings], you do not take any time
off.” — Trungpa Rinpoche

“You are neither too enthusiastic about under-
standing Buddhism nor are you too disinterested.”
— Trungpa Rinpoche

I was surprised to find myself actually somewhat relieved
to be on my own. I drove towards Virginia, taking my time
on the trip. Every day, along the way, I would spend hours
intensely studying the hinayana and mahayana, and the rest
of time practicing the hinayana and mahayana, around the
clock, without break. Trungpa Rinpoche’s book on the ma-
hayana was dense, but I chugged along anyway.

I started feeling continuously joyous for the first time since
the Snowden revelation.
