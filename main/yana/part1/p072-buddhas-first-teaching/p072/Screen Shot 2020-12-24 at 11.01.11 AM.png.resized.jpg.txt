Buddha’s first teaching

The legend of Buddha’s first teaching goes something like this:

About 2,600 years ago, in India, a baby boy named
Siddhartha was born into a family of warriors. As
Siddhartha grew up, his family shielded him from
the harsh realities of life. He didn’t encounter
old age, sickness, and death until he was 29 years
old—and when he did discover old age, sickness,
and death it was a crisis for him.

He needed to know the answer to life, the universe,
and everything, so he left his wife and baby, and
spent the following several years figuring it out.
His journey culminated with his sudden enlight-
enment, and he became the Buddha.

Shortly after his enlightenment, the Buddha gave
his first teaching, known as The Four Noble Truths:

1. Life is duhkha, which roughly translates to
“shitty.” Life is characterized by suffering,
dissatisfaction, anxiety, stress, discontentment,
and so on. Even if you’re happy, and have ev-
erything you think you want, there’s at least
still an underlying uneasiness you can’t figure
out how to escape. Why can’t you sit quietly
and relish the boring present moment?

2. The reason life is shitty is because of desire.
Whatever present moment you find yourself
in, you want a different present moment. The
quest for entertainment haunts you.
