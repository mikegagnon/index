I was tweeting directly to NSA. I developed the suspicion that
NSA had hacked my computer and could detect my thoughts
via the side channel of my keyboard typing patterns. Does my
typing cadence betray my deepest secrets? The probability
seemed so small, but the risk was so great. Should I try to
type slower?

A helicopter hovered over my house.

A black sedan followed me home from work.

Lena begged me to see a psychiatrist, and when I did, the
psychiatrist listened to everything, and said: maybe they are
really going after you.
