High-density Bombs

A high-density bomb is a tiny bomb that has a huge effect.
For example, the atomic bombs used in World War 2 were
high-density bombs. 9/11 was a high-density bomb.

In cyberspace, hackers sometimes have the opportunity to
send a slow, perhaps imperceptible, stream of information at
a target, which causes the target to become overloaded. Once
overloaded, the target is effectively dead and can no longer
perform its function. It would be like if you had the capability
to shutdown Wikipedia using only your laptop.

But, for a high-density cyberbomb to work, you must iden-
tify a specific vulnerability in the target—like the Rebels and
the Death Star. Discovering a vulnerability is probably the
trickiest part of the whole attack. The precise nature of the
vulnerability determines what bits the attacker must send to
trigger the explosion, how many bits the attacker must send,
and so on.

Furthermore, there will be some point after you’ve launched
your attack, perhaps minutes, hours, or days, after which the
defenders will discover the flaw your attack is abusing, fix
the flaw, and tell all their friends about the flaw and its fix,
thereby rendering your particular bomb impotent thereafter.

It is a common practice within cybersecurity circles to
boost sales by spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt. With
that said, high-density cyberbombs scare me. Perhaps I have
drank too much of my own kool aid, and everything is going
to be groovy.
