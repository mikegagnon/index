Rosabella

In Fort Collins, Matthew and I split up, and I ended I mak-
ing eye contact with a woman, sitting alone on a patio to an
Ethiopian restaurant, sipping coffee from the smallest mug I
had ever seen. The patio was covered in construction mate-
rials, and a sign on the door said: “Closed.”

We smiled. I said, “Hello.” She said, “Hello.”

She told me I looked familiar, and asked if we knew each
other. I said I don’t think so. Then, she told me her name is
Rosabella, and she invited me into her restaurant, for coffee
and tea.

We told each other stories. Rosabella told me how the
barber next door to her restaurant had recently retired, so
she had leased his old barbershop, tore down the wall, and
was now expanding her restaurant. She expressed her wish
that she could feed me, but she didn’t have any food at the
moment.

I told her about the Black Hawk project. Also, I had
just launched a website, TravelingBuddha.org, to help join to-
gether traveling spirituality teachers with students who would
like to host them: teachings in exchange for a few days of food
and shelter.

She loved the idea of Traveling Buddha, and told me a
story or two about her adventures with spirituality and trav-
eling.

Then, a man walked into her restaurant carrying, what
turned out to be, an industrial strength juicer—a gift for Ros-
abella. She stood up smiling, and said “Thank you! Thank
you! Thank you!” The benefactor expressed his gratitude to
Rosabella and said he was happy to have come across the
juicer, in some random fashion, and knew Rosabella would
love it, and would use it to heal people with her food. Then,
he said he had to run, so he left.
