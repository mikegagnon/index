<br />
In Fort Collins, Matthew and I split up, and I ended I mak-<br />
ing eye contact with a woman, sitting alone on a patio to an<br />
Ethiopian restaurant, sipping coffee from the smallest mug I<br />
had ever seen. The patio was covered in construction mate-<br />
rials, and a sign on the door said: &ldquo;Closed.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
We smiled. I said, &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
She told me I looked familiar, and asked if we knew each<br />
other. I said I don&rsquo;t think so. Then, she told me her name is<br />
Rosabella, and she invited me into her restaurant, for coffee<br />
and tea.<br />
<br />
We told each other stories. Rosabella told me how the<br />
barber next door to her restaurant had recently retired, so<br />
she had leased his old barbershop, tore down the wall, and<br />
was now expanding her restaurant. She expressed her wish<br />
that she could feed me, but she didn&rsquo;t have any food at the<br />
moment.<br />
<br />
I told her about the Black Hawk project. Also, I had<br />
just launched a website, TravelingBuddha.org, to help join to-<br />
gether traveling spirituality teachers with students who would<br />
like to host them: teachings in exchange for a few days of food<br />
and shelter.<br />
<br />
She loved the idea of Traveling Buddha, and told me a<br />
story or two about her adventures with spirituality and trav-<br />
eling.<br />
<br />
Then, a man walked into her restaurant carrying, what<br />
turned out to be, an industrial strength juicer&mdash;a gift for Ros-<br />
abella. She stood up smiling, and said &ldquo;Thank you! Thank<br />
you! Thank you!&rdquo; The benefactor expressed his gratitude to<br />
Rosabella and said he was happy to have come across the<br />
juicer, in some random fashion, and knew Rosabella would<br />
love it, and would use it to heal people with her food. Then,<br />
he said he had to run, so he left.<br />
