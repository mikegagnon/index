Rosabella laughed, and said, “Now, if we only had fruits
and vegetables, then I could feed you.”

Ten minutes later, someone showed up, this time with an-
other gift for Rosabella—a large bow] of fruits and vegetables.

Rosabella laughed, and said, “Now, I can feed you!” She
made fresh juice for me, pointing out the various healing prop-
erties of the various ingredients. Finally, before offering me
the juice she made, she held the cup in her hands, closed her
eyes, and said a prayer.

After I had juice with Rosabella, I said “Thank you! Thank
you! Thank you!” and I was on my way. But Rosabella, said
“Wait. Before you go, here, take this,” and offered me a
twenty dollar bill. I tried to turn down her gift; she didn’t
know I had plenty of money, but she insisted, so I took her
gift, and I was on my way. On my way out, she told me:
“Your spiritual energy is rising.”
