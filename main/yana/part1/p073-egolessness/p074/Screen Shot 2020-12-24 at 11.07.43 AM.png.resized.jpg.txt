brain has unconsciously drawn a boundary around a certain
subset of particles, and labeled that subset “me.” All the par-
ticles outside of you are labeled “other.” See Figure 79.1.

But, it is possible to see yourself as being one with the
universe, by removing the imaginary boundary between you
and other. The boundary is imaginary in the sense that it
exists only in living brains. If you were purely at peace with
yourself, other, and the entire universe as a whole, your brain
would no longer have the need to imagine a separation be-
tween self and other, and you would become one with the
universe. See Figure 79.2.
