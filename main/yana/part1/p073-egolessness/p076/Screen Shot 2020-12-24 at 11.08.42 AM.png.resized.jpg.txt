According to Buddhism, nirvana is a very nice place to be,
but although we would like to hang out there, we are stuck
in samsara: the world of illusion, imagination, and delusion.
Basically, every experience we experience is created in our
brains. When photons strike the rods and cones inside your
eye balls, it triggers signals to your brain, which then draws
an image, which you see. And so on, for your other senses.

Everyone in samsara is crazy, in the sense that everyone
holds various delusion beliefs as facts—chief among them, the
belief that we truly exist, at the deepest level of reality.

We are figments of our own imaginations; we don’t really
exist; and, we are fundamentally egoless.

I ran to Lena, and tried explaining it to her, but the
metaphors that worked for me weren’t working for her. So, I
explained to her how our marriage was fundamentally imag-
inary: the only reason we think we’re married is because a
bunch of other people think we’re married too—it’s all in our
brains.

I could see it in her eyes: she understood.

For me, egolessness was a relief. It was a truth I had given
up on years ago, and had now rediscovered.

For Lena, it was a crisis. For the next 10 minutes, I assured
and reassured Lena that I loved her, that our marriage was
real, and I would never leave her.
