Figure 79.2: “Me,” at one with the universe

 

But being at one with the universe is not true egolessness,
for there is still a notion of “me,” even though you are iden-
tifying with the entire universe. Rather, true egolessness is
absent of a notion of “me” entirely. See figure 79.3.

Figure 79.3: Egolessness

 

I was surprised to discover that Buddhism’s notion of ego-
lessness matched my teenage insight. In Buddhism, egoless-
ness is variously referred at as shunyata, emptiness, absolute
reality, nirvana, and so on.
