You’re just acting right now.
Everyone is acting.

I don’t know anyone.
Everyone’s out to get me.

I need a divorce.

Then I can be alone.

The next morning, I explained to Lena: “No, I don’t want
a divorce. That wasn’t me. Another ego from my brain tem-
porarily took over my body, I love you, I’ll never leave you.”
