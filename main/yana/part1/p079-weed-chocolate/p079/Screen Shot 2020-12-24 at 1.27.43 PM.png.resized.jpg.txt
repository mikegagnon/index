Cannabis chocolate

Lena and I shared a small chocolate bar infused with cannabis.
We turned on a PBS documentary about Buddhism, and,
around 30 minutes into it, I started feeling anxious. A few
minutes later, the room felt more 3D than usual. I turned to
Lena and she looked like a cartoon, and I knew I was going to
die. I keeled over, died, and another ego from within my brain
took over. The following poem describes what happened next.

There is a part of my brain that wants to be alone,
But I have shut it up,

Blocked it off,

Shut it down.

And now it’s out of touch with reality.

And now it has control of my body.

Where the fuck am I?

Who the fuck am I?

Who the fuck are you?

When was the last time I was alone?

Why haven’t I ever been alone in my life?

Is this a joke?

Is this real?

Are we robots?

Who are you again?

You keep whispering “It’s ok... It’s ok... It’s ok”
But this is not ok.

And I can tell you’re lying.
