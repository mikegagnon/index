                      <div style='text-align: left;'>I found myself in front of a group of student hackers telling<br />
tall tales of hacking glory. Then I asked them: are you ready<br />
for a riddle?<br />
<br />
If you plug two computers into each other via an<br />
ethernet cable, do they become one, single com-<br />
puter?<br />
<br />
They couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. I tried explaining it to them,<br />
but I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to break through. It felt like I<br />
was pointing at a computer and saying: &ldquo;Look! It&rsquo;s a com-<br />
puter! Why can&rsquo;t you see the computer!?&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Someone proposed we grab beers, so we grabbed beers.<br />
Then, I became drunk, and bumped into someone passing by,<br />
who asked me if I had weed. I smiled, said yes and we smoked<br />
together in an alley.<br />
<br />
It turned out he was without a home and he was also ad-<br />
dicted to alcohol and he was also in a lot of physical pain.<br />
Leaning into the my bodhisattva vow, I reached out and em-<br />
pathized with his pain, which actually helped alleviate some<br />
of his suffering. It was working!<br />
<br />
T leaned in as much as I could, soaking up all the pain that<br />
I could.<br />
<br />
We camped out in the alley, I gave him pith instructions<br />
on the hinayana, and when I woke up the next morning, I<br />
looked at him and became full of unbearable pain.<br />
<br />
I had to do something about the pain. I called my sister,<br />
and started to cry as our conversation began. She urged me<br />
to go to the emergency room, and I agreed, hoping they would<br />
give me pain killers, and fearing that they would lock me up<br />
in a psych ward.<br />
<br />
I realized I must be doing something wrong with the ma-<br />
hayana, and resolved that once I made it out of the hospital,<br />
no matter how long it took, I would escape to a Shambhala<br />
retreat center.<br />
