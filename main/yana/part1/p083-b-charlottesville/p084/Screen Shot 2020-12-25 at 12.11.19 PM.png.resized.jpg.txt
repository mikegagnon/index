I found myself in front of a group of student hackers telling
tall tales of hacking glory. Then I asked them: are you ready
for a riddle?

If you plug two computers into each other via an
ethernet cable, do they become one, single com-
puter?

They couldn’t figure it out. I tried explaining it to them,
but I couldn’t figure out how to break through. It felt like I
was pointing at a computer and saying: “Look! It’s a com-
puter! Why can’t you see the computer!?”

Someone proposed we grab beers, so we grabbed beers.
Then, I became drunk, and bumped into someone passing by,
who asked me if I had weed. I smiled, said yes and we smoked
together in an alley.

It turned out he was without a home and he was also ad-
dicted to alcohol and he was also in a lot of physical pain.
Leaning into the my bodhisattva vow, I reached out and em-
pathized with his pain, which actually helped alleviate some
of his suffering. It was working!

T leaned in as much as I could, soaking up all the pain that
I could.

We camped out in the alley, I gave him pith instructions
on the hinayana, and when I woke up the next morning, I
looked at him and became full of unbearable pain.

I had to do something about the pain. I called my sister,
and started to cry as our conversation began. She urged me
to go to the emergency room, and I agreed, hoping they would
give me pain killers, and fearing that they would lock me up
in a psych ward.

I realized I must be doing something wrong with the ma-
hayana, and resolved that once I made it out of the hospital,
no matter how long it took, I would escape to a Shambhala
retreat center.
