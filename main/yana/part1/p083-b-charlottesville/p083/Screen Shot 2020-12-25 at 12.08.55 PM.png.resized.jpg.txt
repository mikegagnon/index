Charlottesville

“You may not achieve complete liberation right
away, but you can begin the occasional back-and-
forth journey from confusion to freedom.” —Trungpa
Rinpoche

I looked up meditation centers in Virginia, and found that
Charlottesville hosts more Buddhists centers than anywhere
else. A few hours later, I arrived in Charlottesville to dis-
cover that the University of Virginia Computer Science En-
trepreneurship Club was hosting a large party.

Focusing on tasting the flavor of every moment, and search-
ing for opportunities to help others, my anxiety melted away.
