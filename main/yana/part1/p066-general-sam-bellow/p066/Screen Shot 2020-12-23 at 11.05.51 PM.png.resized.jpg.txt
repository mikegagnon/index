General Sam Bellow

LL hosted a conference once, and General Sam Bellow, retired
Vice Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, was scheduled
to give a talk. My father has three master’s degrees and I
happened to know that he coauthored one of his theses with
Bellow, back when they were majors at the Naval War College
in Newport, Rhode Island. The thesis is titled The Proper
Way to Blow a Whistle Within The DoD, and it details how
one can go about improving things within the DoD, even when
the DoD is resisting improvements.

My father had retired from the Air Force several years
earlier, but he maintained an active security clearance doing
who-knows-what-for-who for the government from a civilian
seat, therefore I was able to get him a ticket to the conference
at LL.

My father made sure to sit in the front row for Bellow’s
talk, so when Bellow came out on stage, the first thing he saw
was my father, which made Bellow start laughing. Thinking
my father was now working for LL, and knowing my father is
who my father is, Bellow assumed everyone at LL must know
my father. Bellow’s first comment into the microphone came
with a grin: “I’m really glad to see Bark Thaye here in the
front row, because I was a little insecure about giving a talk
to a bunch of geniuses. But now I know, I’ve got nothing to
worry about.”

But, of course, no one there knew who Bark Thaye was,
so the joke fell flat. I was sitting towards the back. When my
colleagues next to me heard Bellow’s joke, they looked at me,
and I said, “That’s my dad,” and I laughed.
