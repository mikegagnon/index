First grade

Once, when I was six years old, I drew a magnificent picture
of a US Air Force airplane dropping bombs on me. It was
for the cover of my latest book, titled All About Me. My
parents were frightened, but my teacher assured them it was
OK. “Look,” she said, “He’s smiling.”

That same year I experienced my first exposure to pro-
gramming, with the LOGO programming language, at Hickam
Air Force Base Elementary School, two miles from Pearl Har-
bor, Hawaii.
