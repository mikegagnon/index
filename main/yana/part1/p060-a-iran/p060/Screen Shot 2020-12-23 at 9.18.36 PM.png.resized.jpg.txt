Iran

As the story goes, in 1979, my mother just happened to be in
Iran when revolutionary forces overthrew Iran’s government
and began collecting American hostages. At Tehran, Amer-
ican planes of all kinds were scrambling to help evacuate as
many Americans as possible.

But, the commander on my mother’s plane gave the order
to taxi before it was fully loaded. My mother objected, saying
they needed to wait until their plane was full. The comman-
der attempted to squash my mother’s insubordination with
threats of demotion, so she pushed the button that opened
the back cargo ramp. With the cargo ramp open, Americans
who had ran out onto the tarmac were able to board the plane
before take off.

After it was all said and done, the Air Force demoted the
commander, and promoted my mother.
