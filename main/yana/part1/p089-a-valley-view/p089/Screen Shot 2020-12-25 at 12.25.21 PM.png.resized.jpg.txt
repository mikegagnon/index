Valley View Hot Springs

We drove to Valley View Hot Springs, a nudist, nature pre-
serve in central Colorado. A few days in, we were hanging
out in the smoking shelter, when a crew of about 8 people
rolled in, in bathrobes, with a gigantic glass apparatus, and
asked: “Have you ever dabbed before?” I learned right then
that dabbing is an elaborate approach to smoking cannabis
concentrate, and will get you higher than you’ve ever been
before. So, I dabbed, and blasted off, and learned that this
group of eight was in the early stages of creating a medita-
tion retreat center in Black Hawk, Colorado, an hour west of
Denver. We asked if they needed help, and they said: “Yes!”
