Anziety

“We would like to overcome our anxiety, but first
we have to realize that there is no technique and
no trick for doing so. The only way to deal with
it is by means of discipline.” — Trungpa Rinpoche

My anxiety got so bad, I couldn’t bear to go work one
morning. I told Lena I had to quit right now—which would
mean we'd be walking away from half a million dollars since
I was only half way through my contract with Twitter.

Lena supported my decision and we concocted a plan to
travel across the country, camping along the way, then move
in with her sister in Virginia.

We made it as far as Albuquerque.
