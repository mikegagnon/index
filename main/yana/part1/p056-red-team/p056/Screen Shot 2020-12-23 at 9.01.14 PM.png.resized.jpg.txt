Red Team

My father was a colonel in the Air Force. Among many roles,
he served as the Chief Strategist for the Air Force (briefly),
the Commander of Air Space and Ranges (the Air Force’s
proving grounds for fighter jets), and he served in an un-
known role in the Pentagon’s Skunkworks (presumably the
Pentagon’s Air Force unit specializing in secret, experimental
aircraft).

But, before all that, in one of his earliest roles, my father
was tasked to lead a small “red team” as part of a war game
at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. Within most war games,
there’s a blue team and a red team. The blue team represents
the “good guys” and the red team represents the “bad guys.”
In this particular war game, they asked my father to figure out
a way to hijack a C-5 cargo plane, and then do it—without
the blue team ever having the knowledge that, hey, it’s just
a war game.

So, he kidnapped the Base Commander’s wife, took a po-
laroid of her holding up the day’s newspaper, showed that
picture to the Base Commander, and asked the Base Com-
mander to escort him to a C-5, which the Base Commander
did, probably shitting himself the whole way. And, with a
fake bomb cuffed to his hand, my father boarded the plane
with two teammates, and persuaded the pilot to taxi for take-
off.

They didn’t expect the copilot to pop up out of nowhere,
pointing a pistol at them with a shaky hand... so one my
father’s teammates shouted out: “Knock it off! Knock it off!
Knock it off!” which was the code word for the red team to
surrender, and let everyone know it was just an exercise.
