that you are thinking, you are supposed to say “thinking” to
yourself, then bring your attention back to the breath.

I was down for the hinayana in a big way, except I couldn’t
bring myself to meditate. It was too painful to sit still and
when I forced myself to try, on the few occasions that I did, I
couldn’t focus on my breathing at all. Rather, there was just
a waterfall of thoughts that wouldn’t stop.
