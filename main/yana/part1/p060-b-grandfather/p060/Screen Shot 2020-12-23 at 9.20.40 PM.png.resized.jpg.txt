Grandfather

My mother’s father was an electrician in the United States’
Navy during World War 2. After the United States dropped
the bombs in Japan, Japan surrendered, and my grandfather
joined the occupation of Japan. He says the Japanese people
were very kind to him while he was there.

After the war was completely over, an officer approached
him with an envelope labelled: Top Secret. The officer ex-
plained that my grandfather must decide whether to accept or
decline these Top Secret orders, before he was even allowed to
see the orders inside the envelope. My grandfather accepted
the orders, and thus he found himself wiring together the first
set of atomic bombs after the war.
