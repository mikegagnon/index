ton smiling—or perhaps grinning, or perhaps fake smiling. He
grabbed my father’s hand, shook it, and said: “Good to meet
you Bark. But, where’s your good-for-nothing brother?”

My father is known for his wit, charm, and sporadic, in-
tense anger—but in this singular circumstance, the cleverest
thing my father could think to stammer was: “He’s in Rhode
Island keeping the criminals off the streets.”

President Clinton laughed, and a photographer snapped
a photo of President Clinton’s staged smile outshining my
father’s staged smile.

Ever since my father framed that picture in a wooden
frame, it has been resting on a shelf in my parent’s library,
next to a framed picture of my father shaking Al Gore’s hand.

So, that’s the story of the one time, that I’m aware of,
where my father was intimidated. I realize the story is anti-
climatic, but that’s just how it happened. I don’t know why
he was intimidated. But that’s the story.

Lastly, my father’s life slogan is: “Don’t take no if yes is
the right answer,” and I’m no Bill Clinton, so imagine being
the poor bastard raised by my father.
