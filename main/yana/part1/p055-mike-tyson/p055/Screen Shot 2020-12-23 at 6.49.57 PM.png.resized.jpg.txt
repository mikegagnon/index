Mike Tyson

I grew up on the tall tales of my mother and father. For
instance, once, during the time when I was in preschool, my
family was stationed at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, which
is adjacent to Las Vegas, and 83 miles southeast of Area 51,

down into his seat, looked to Mike Tyson, and said, “I have
the tickets.”

father.
