DARPA

Shortly after I joined Twitter, DARPA invited “boutique”
hackers from across America to submit proposals for revo-
lutionary cybersecurity research and development. DARPA
is the military agency that invented the Internet, GPS, and
stealth airplanes.

I proposed to fund myself and a colleague to develop and
test a new defense against high-density cyberbombs, essen-
tially picking up where my Harvard thesis left off. DARPA
awarded me a six-month, six-figure grant, so I ended up work-
ing two full-time jobs for a period of time in Silicon Valley. I
named my cyber defense: Beer Garden.

We built Beer Garden and tested it against a slew of at-
tacks, targeting a variety of web applications, and it worked!
Well, it only worked for half of the web applications we tested.
The reason it didn’t work for the other half, is because the
“bouncer” component was prohibitively inefficient for web
applications implemented in certain programming languages.
But, in principle, with bespoke optimizations, Beer Garden
could be adapted to suit any web application.

The Pentagon invited my colleague and me to present Beer
Garden from their courtyard.
