Harvard

When I was in the second grade, my family moved from
Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii to Boston, Massachusetts,
because the Air Force and Harvard teamed up so my father
could research national security at The Kennedy School of
Government. They didn’t award him a master’s degree, be-
cause, according to my father, he already had more degrees
than a thermometer.

Years later, LL gave me a full scholarship to study at any
Boston-area school, fulltime. While applying to Harvard for
a Ph.D. in computer science, I came across a question on the
application that asked me if I had any Harvard alumni in my
family. I called my dad and asked him what I should respond
with, since I knew he was a Harvard fellow, but not a Harvard
graduate. He said: “I have yet to donate a penny to Harvard,
so I wouldn’t recommend listing me.”

I followed my father’s recommendation, Harvard accepted
me, and I joined. My master’s thesis described a mathemati-
cal defense against a certain class of high-density cyberbombs,
complete with a few theorems and formal proofs. But, before I
could complete my Ph.D. dissertation, and after I had earned
a master’s degree, I was lured away from Harvard, LL, and
the Air Force to join Silicon Valley on the quest to become a
millionaire.
