Seventh grade

I was terrified of my parents’ wrath, but in the seventh grade
I really wanted to break out of AOL’s walled garden, so I
took a risk and wrote a contacts-list application with many
features including usernames and passwords. I stored all the
passwords in plaintext, so I could see them later when no one
was looking.

I showed my mother my latest creation, and asked her
to create an account on my app. She obliged, but when it
prompted her for a password, she looked at me sternly, told
me she wasn’t going to type in a password, and left the room.

Later, I showed my father the app, and when it prompted
him for a password, he looked at me, winked, and typed in
his AOL password.
