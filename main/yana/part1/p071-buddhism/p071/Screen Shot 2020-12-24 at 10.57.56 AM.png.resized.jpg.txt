Buddhism

I didn’t know what to believe anymore, so I went searching
for truth and found Buddhism. The first Buddhist story that
caught my eye goes something like this:

The Buddha and his retinue rolled into a village
one day and the Buddha offered a teaching. After
the teaching, someone in the crowd said to Bud-
dha: “Every week a new spiritual teacher shows
up and offers a teaching that contradicts all the
previous teachings given by all the other teachers.
Why should we believe you?”

The Buddha said: “Great question. Basically, it’s
up to you to figure out what’s true and what’s
not. Skepticism is good. But, at the same time, it
just might be the case that the only way for you
to see the truth of my teachings is to try out my
advice and see if it actually works.” And then the
Buddha gave a bunch of advice.

I ran to Lena and told her the story, while she listened
and smiled. In retrospect, I think she was probably relieved
