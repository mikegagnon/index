Black Hawk

They had jerry rigged a campground on a plot of mountain-
ous private land, with fresh spring water bubbling up. Our
landlord was collaborating with the meditators to build the
center, and he claimed that his spring water was the purest
on Earth, corroborated by lab results I never saw, but which
everyone believed in.

We must of stayed there two weeks, but then Matthew
and I left to visit to Fort Collins, Colorado, two hours north,
near the Wyoming border. I donâ€™t remember why.
