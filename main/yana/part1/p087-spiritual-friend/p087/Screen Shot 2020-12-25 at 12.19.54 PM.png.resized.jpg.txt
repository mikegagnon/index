teacher student relationship is workable and be-
comes a delightful dance. The teacher might play
the music, and you might dance to the rhythm.
That is the principle of the spiritual friend.” —

Matthew was living in a small log cabin, on a giant prop-
erty owned by an art patron. Many artists lived on the land,
in various accommodations, and a strangely lit, winding-maze
of an old limestone mine hosted galleries and workspaces for
