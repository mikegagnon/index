artists. Steel artists, there, built kinetic Burning Man sculp-
tures. Others painted, sewed prayer flags, etc.

I arrived at the small log cabin, described in my instruc-
tions. Sitting outside the cabin was Matthew in khaki shorts
and no shirt, wearing flip flops, using a pencil and compass
to draw tessellated geometry upon a piece of paper.

He welcomed me in, and one of the first things I noticed
was his book collection, stacked vertically. The book on top
was titled, Vajrayana Secrets.

Matthew said I was free to read the book, but he wouldn’t
teach me anything about the vajrayana because he wasn’t a
guru. Instead, he offered to be my spiritual friend, and I said
“Yes!”

I had difficulty meditating at the Telluride retreat. My
anxiety had come back. I could barely force myself to sit.
I asked Matthew for help with my meditation practice, but
rather than offering words of wisdom on how to better force
myself to sit, he suggested I landscape the land surrounding
the cabin.

It took me a few days to achieve the desired landscape,
and when I was done, Matthew surveyed my work, and said
“Nice work. We need to leave now. Our landlord is evicting
us.”

It turned out that while the owner of the cabin didn’t
mind hosting Matthew, the landlord did object to turning
their property into a retreat center.
