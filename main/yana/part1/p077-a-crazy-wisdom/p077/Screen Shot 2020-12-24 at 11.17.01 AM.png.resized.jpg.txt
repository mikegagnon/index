Crazy Wisdom

On Netflix, I did a search for Buddhism and found a docu-
mentary called Crazy Wisdom about the “bad boy of Tibetan
Buddhism.” The film stunned me into adherence.

Crazy Wisdom is about a Tibetan monk named Chégyam
Trungpa Rinpoche, who became enlightened and cultivated
a following amongst hippies in America in the late 1960’s.
He ate meat, had many girlfriends, and he drank himself to
death. And, he invited the world to co-create an enlightened
society based on the recognition that we are all basically good.
He named his movement: Shambhala.

According to the documentary, Trungpa Rinpoche’s crazy-
wisdom teaching style confounded most people, because in a
world where everyone is crazy, sanity appears crazy.

Here was an enlightened person living life to the fullest. I
saw no contradiction, and I was relieved by the thought that I
could be like him and party hard, rather than sitting in lotus
posture in a cave for the rest of my life.
