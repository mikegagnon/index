Virginia

I made it to Virginia, and Lena and I reunited with a hug.
We promised each other we would save our relationship, and
her sister welcomed me into her home.

But I couldn’t bear to be there because I felt so dominated
by their energy. They were used to me being one way, but I
was trying to break free of my old self and be a new person, a
bodhisattva. I couldn’t be the joyous person with them, the
way I was when I was alone. My anxiety came back stronger
than it had ever been.

Perhaps my third night at Lena’s sister’s house I woke up
in the middle of night and started vomiting and bawling from
anxiety, in the bathroom attached to our bedroom.

Strangely, I had unconsciously packed my suitcase the day
before, so, to leave all I had to do was to grab my suitcase,
step out the door, and say “I’ll be back once I’m enlightened.”

Lena hired a lawyer and filed for divorce.
