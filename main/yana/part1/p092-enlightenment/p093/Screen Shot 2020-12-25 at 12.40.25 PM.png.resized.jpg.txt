I can only remember so much about this experience, be-
cause amnesia set in shortly thereafter. But, I do remember
viscerally being one with the universe, I knew I was enlight-
ened, I could see through story, and I felt silly for sitting
down—it were as if sitting meditation were a joke that I was
tricked into and all the buddhas were laughing with me. So,
I stood up.

A cascade of realizations flowed through my mind. I re-
alized how important I was: an enlightened military hacker
who has the ability to empathize with everyone. I could see
the powers of Earth, trying to intimidate, negotiate, attack,
retreat, and so on. And, I could see my role in the center of
everything—a universal diplomat who represents all people
equally.

I stepped outside my bedroom, and I bumped into my
mother. Our eyes met, and I was seeing ourselves through all
four of our eyeballs. I stood up on the island in our kitchen
and proclaimed myself enlightened to my parents.
