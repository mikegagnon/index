Enlightenment

“The enlightenment flash of the eleventh bhumi
does not take place by acting, but by sitting. Pre-
viously you may have focused on actions, on work-
ing with sentient beings, and on developing a com-
passionate attitude, and so forth. But at the ac-
tual time the birth of enlightenment takes place,
you decide to sit, just like Gautama Buddha. The
point at which enlightenment occurs is not so much
while you are sitting as a discipline, but when you
begin to sit for relaxation.” — Trungpa Rinpoche

“Supposing, if you become enlightened. Then what?
Of course automatically the answer is then, of
course, I have become Buddha. Enlightened. You
are about to become an egomaniac.” — Trungpa
Rinpoche
