Whistleblower

Once, when I was working at LL, I decided to blow the whistle
on a problem I thought deserved a whistle. I studied my
father’s thesis, and decided the best action would be to call
my father. I explained to him that I needed to blow a whistle,
and who (in general terms) I needed to alert, but I didn’t
reveal any classified information.

My father said OK, then somehow arranged a meeting
with a senior member of DoD leadership. We walked into the
Pentagon together, and my father navigated the corridors,
until we arrived at the office we were looking for. A secretary
asked us to wait, and when it was our time, we stepped into
the office.

“Bark!” the senior leader said, as we entered. They shook
hands with smiles. “Please, sit down, sit down” he said, ush-
ering us into seats.

“Check this out,” he said, pointing to a small framed pic-
ture, on his desk. The picture was of him and my father,
shaking hands. My father beamed.

They exchanged small talk for a few minutes, then, even-
tually, the senior leader asked why my father called this meet-
ing.
My father explained that I needed to blow a whistle. The
senior leader frowned, and asked me to tell him what the
problem was. So, I told him. It took a few minutes to explain.

When I finished my spiel, there was a pause. Then, he
said something, I don’t remember what, but it was certainly
a disapproval of my judgement to blow a whistle. He opened
up the big, bottom drawer of his desk and beckoned us to look
inside. It was a pile of framed photographs—pictures of him
shaking hands with various people. He said, “Look, I keep
all sorts of pictures here, for whenever an old friend shows
up.” Then he picked up the picture of him and my father and
threw it in the drawer, and slammed it shut.
