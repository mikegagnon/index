<br />
Once, when I was working at LL, I decided to blow the whistle<br />
on a problem I thought deserved a whistle. I studied my<br />
father&rsquo;s thesis, and decided the best action would be to call<br />
my father. I explained to him that I needed to blow a whistle,<br />
and who (in general terms) I needed to alert, but I didn&rsquo;t<br />
reveal any classified information.<br />
<br />
My father said OK, then somehow arranged a meeting<br />
with a senior member of DoD leadership. We walked into the<br />
Pentagon together, and my father navigated the corridors,<br />
until we arrived at the office we were looking for. A secretary<br />
asked us to wait, and when it was our time, we stepped into<br />
the office.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Bark!&rdquo; the senior leader said, as we entered. They shook<br />
hands with smiles. &ldquo;Please, sit down, sit down&rdquo; he said, ush-<br />
ering us into seats.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Check this out,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a small framed pic-<br />
ture, on his desk. The picture was of him and my father,<br />
shaking hands. My father beamed.<br />
<br />
They exchanged small talk for a few minutes, then, even-<br />
tually, the senior leader asked why my father called this meet-<br />
ing.<br />
My father explained that I needed to blow a whistle. The<br />
senior leader frowned, and asked me to tell him what the<br />
problem was. So, I told him. It took a few minutes to explain.<br />
<br />
When I finished my spiel, there was a pause. Then, he<br />
said something, I don&rsquo;t remember what, but it was certainly<br />
a disapproval of my judgement to blow a whistle. He opened<br />
up the big, bottom drawer of his desk and beckoned us to look<br />
inside. It was a pile of framed photographs&mdash;pictures of him<br />
shaking hands with various people. He said, &ldquo;Look, I keep<br />
all sorts of pictures here, for whenever an old friend shows<br />
up.&rdquo; Then he picked up the picture of him and my father and<br />
threw it in the drawer, and slammed it shut.<br />
