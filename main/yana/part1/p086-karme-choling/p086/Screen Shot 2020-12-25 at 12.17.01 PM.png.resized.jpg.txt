Karmé Choling

“Although you might try to come out clean, the
blame always starts with you.” — Trungpa Rin-
poche

“How often have you turned away, because you
feared you might discover something terrible about
yourself ?” — Trungpa Rinpoche

“So it is extremely important to be willing to open
yourself to yourself.” — Trungpa Rinpoche

It took me several days at Karmé Chdling before I real-
ized it wasn’t the paragon of enlightenment I expected it to
be. So, I made it my mission to enlighten Karmé Chéling. I
moved into a house called Ethics (with neither permission nor
admonition), renovated it (with neither permission nor admo-
nition), and began selling sunscreen, chocolates, cigarettes,
and wine from Ethics—which is when I began receiving ad-
monitions. Then, they kicked me out for sexual harassment.

For a long time, I was in denial that I sexually harassed
someone at Karmé Chdling. I used to think that denial was
when someone denied something they knew to be true. But
actually, denial is a form of delusion, where you refuse to ac-
cept reality. It wasn’t until years later, that I realized the
way I attempted to flirt at Karmé Chdling had been violat-
ing. Not only that, but now I can also see other ways I’ve
perpetrated sexual misconduct at other times in my life, as
well. I am sorry.
