Flight nurse

My mother was a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force. While
my dad was working behind desks on various military bases,
my mother was a flight nurseâ€”flying around the world, taking
care of service men and women, while in flight on hospital
air planes. She once came close to delivering a baby in a
helicopter.
