Preface

I am intimately familiar with computer science and Bud-
dhism. I have been studying and practicing computer science
for decades, and I have been studying and practicing Bud-
dhism for about seven years. This book presents a collection
of essays relating to computer science, Buddhism, mathemat-
ics, science, engineering, and so on.

I originally planned for this book to function as a fountain
code. This way, you could randomly read any N chapters, say
10 chapters, in any order, and then through a poof of mathe-
matical magic, you would suddenly understand my message. I
also toyed around with revealing my message through Shamir
secret sharing or perhaps a Reed-Solomon code or perhaps via
the Vidyadhara’s tantric implementation of self secrecy, but, I
have abandoned these tempting ideas, because I have decided
to rush publication.

This book isn’t even finished yet. I won’t tell you upfront
in the Preface why I am rushing publication, because I don’t
want to spoil the ending, which is located somewhere between
the lines, in one or more of these chapters.

Towards part of my original concept for this book, I have
made a haphazard effort to highlight key terms in a san-serif
font, like this this font. My plan was to place a See Also section
at the end of every chapter, which, for each key term that ap-
peared in that chapter, contained either or forward-reference
or a backward-reference pointing to a chapter that dove deep
into that key term. Another idea that tempted me, was to
feed these forward- and backward-references into a Page Rank
