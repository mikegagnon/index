IV. YOU AND AUGMENTED REALITY

You experience life through a lens of augmented reality, con-
structed automatically by your brain. Take sight for example.

When you “see” something with your naked eye, the video feed
is merely the result of your brain subconsciously interpreting the
electrical signals that fire when photon particles strike the rods and
cones inside your eyeballs. The video feed that you witness through
your eyeballs and brain is constructed in your brain. The main point
here is that when you see something, your subconscious brain draws
boundaries around what appear to be solid objects. See Figure 4.
