V. DEAUGMENTED REALITY

Perhaps it is possible to de-augment your perception of reality.
“That is, perhaps it’s possible to escape Plato's Cave, and experience
‘a state of mind where some, or all, of your brain's superimpositions
are dropped.

VI. Tih REALITY BENEATH YOUR AUGMENTED REALITY

The deepest reality, the reality beneath the superimpositions
experience, s emptiness. Everything we experience isthe result of a
brains superimposing thoughts, ideas, perceptions, emotions, and
on, overtop the reality of the universe, which simply can be mode
as n collection of particles. If we were to somehow discag tt
superimpositions that our brains create, we wouldn't see the
because everything we see is a superimposition atop anything,
devoid of everything we know. Happy Halloween! ©’ "ts
