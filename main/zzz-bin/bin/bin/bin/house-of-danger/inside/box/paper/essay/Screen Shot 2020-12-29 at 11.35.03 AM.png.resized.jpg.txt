the app sutomaucally detects the bonter between the mountain and

TV, You AND AUGMENTED REALITY

‘You experience life through a lens of augmented reality, con-

‘When you “see” something with your naked eye, the video feed
is merely the result of your brain subconsciously interpreting the
electrical signals that fire when photon particles strike the rods and

‘your eyeballs and brain is constructed in your brain. The main point
here is that when you see something, your subconscious brain draws
boundaries around what appear to be solid objects. See Figure 4.

brains superimposing thoughts, ideas, perceptions, emotions, and

as a collection of particles. If we were to somehow dis a
superimpositions that our brains create, we wouldn't see
because everything we see is 8 superimposition atop
devoid of everything we know. Happy Halloween!
