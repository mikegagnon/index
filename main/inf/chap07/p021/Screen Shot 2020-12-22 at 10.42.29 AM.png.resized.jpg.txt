Chapter 7

Divergence

All the Professor Steves, all except one, refrained from using
the Emergency Doorman Protocol. With the knowledge that
they’re living in a simulation, they moved on to simple lives
of nihilistic hedonism, trying to maximize their pleasure in
every moment, with the belief that at any moment they are
likely to be annihilated.

But one Professor Steve, the original Professor Steve at the
top-level of genuine reality, followed the Emergency Doorman
Protocol. Unlike the others, he wasn’t hardcoded to live a life
of pure self-interest. While the fear of annihilation weighed
heavy on the all the Professor Steves, the original also felt the
weight of saving an infinite number of lives and averting the
upcoming violence of WW5 in an infinite number of realities.

At 5 o’clock, when his officemate wasn’t looking, he pulled
out his bottle of Louis XIII and slipped it in his bag. He
raced to Boston from Lexington, parallel parked his car over
a snow bank, and walked straight to Jimmy’s door on Beacon
Street, in the Back Bay neighborhood. Jimmy was a retired
three-star general from the United States Cyber Force.

He knocked on the door, and Jimmy opened it.
