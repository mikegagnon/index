The Emergency Doorman
Protocol

After the Pug Catastrophe of 2021, the US Department of De-
fense implemented the Emergency Doorman Protocol, so that
individuals can quickly report critical information up a chain
of command, outside of the chain of command. It’s meant to
keep the system working when the chain of command fails.

It works almost like bribery.

Let’s say you want to get a message to the President of the
United States of America. First, you need to identify your
doorman to the President, which is someone you know, say
Susie, who is one step closer to the President than you are.
Then, you tell Susie your message and offer Susie a gift—but
that gift isn’t for Susie, rather it’s for the President. The gift
demonstrates your belief in the importance of the message.
If Susie agrees your message should go to the President, then
she accepts your gift and she then uses the protocol herself to
take the message one step closer to the President. Technically,
she’s allowed to regift your gift, but she’s supposed to offer
up a greater gift of her own if possible.
