Chapter 21

Arrest

Professor Steve stopped his van, turned the engine off, and
peed his pants.

“Put your hands out the window!” shouted a megaphone.

Shaking, he put his hands out the window, and began shout-
ing “I’m sorry! I’m sorry!”

The SWAT team swooped in and cuffed him, pulled him out

his vehicle, placed him in the back of an unmarked police car,
and took him to jail.
