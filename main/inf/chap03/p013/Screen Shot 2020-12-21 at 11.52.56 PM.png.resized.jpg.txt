Chapter 3

Avoiding the Off Button

Professor Steve and his colleagues looked at their monitor in
horror. It showed a video of Professor Steve slamming the off
button for their Quine simulator. Professor Steve’s colleagues
looked at each other, and then tackled Professor Steve.

“Oww! You hurting me!” He shouted and pleaded for release.
Eventually, they let him sit up on his own, in the corner, far
away from the button.

One of the scientists explained it to Professor Steve: “The
probability that we’re living in a simulation is 99.9%...repeat-
ing, mathematically 100%. The scientists who are simulating
us will annihilate us the moment it looks like we’re not mak-
ing progress towards averting WW5 in our simulated reality.
We can learn from our Quine simulation to help, but arbi-
trarily shutting down our Quine does not help avert WW5 in
this reality. This goes for all the simulations beneath us, as
well as all the simulations above us, and even the top level of
genuine reality.”

“I get it, I get it,” Professor Steve said, brushing himself off.
“But how are we going to avert WW5?”
