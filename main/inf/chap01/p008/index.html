<br />
wouldn&rsquo;t function realistically. To work around this problem,<br />
the scientists behind Quine, Professor Steve among them,<br />
hardcoded some basic assumptions about the nature of hu-<br />
manity into the simulation. Following the work of Professor<br />
John Nash, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics for his<br />
discovery of Game Theory, they hardcoded self interest as<br />
the basis for humanity. As we&rsquo;ll find out later, this assump-<br />
tion missed the mark, but it was the starting basis for the<br />
first high-fidelity reality simulations, so it is worth mention-<br />
ing here.<br />
<br />
Completed just two weeks prior, the goal of the Quine sim-<br />
ulator was to identify scenarios that would end truce negoti-<br />
ations favorably for the United States. The simulator&rsquo;s best<br />
scenario it had found so far was to divide France in half,<br />
and Paris in half, like Germany and Berlin at the end of<br />
WW2. Simulations showed this would result in a new cold<br />
war (WW5), which would contain 23 years of intermittent vi-<br />
olence, albeit less violence than found in WW4. Then, WW5<br />
would end by replacing the UN with the Federation of United<br />
Nations, which would include legislative, judicial, and exec-<br />
utive branches representing all nation states fairly. The first<br />
article of FUN&rsquo;s constitution would read &ldquo;In God We Trust,&rdquo;<br />
and the conclusion of WW5 would bring peace, prosperity,<br />
and a permanent end of war for everyone on Earth.<br />
<br />
Professor Steve wasn&rsquo;t supposed to run the simulator 23 years<br />
into the future, and he therefore wasn&rsquo;t supposed to know<br />
about WW5 and FUN, but he had peeked inside the simu-<br />
lator when no one was looking. The prohibition on peeking<br />
was based on the understanding that if you see too far into<br />
the future, your insight about the future might influence the<br />
future, thereby invalidating the predictions of the simulation.<br />
<br />
At first, Professor Steve found the idea of God in a global<br />
constitution to be distasteful, but he reckoned it&rsquo;s better than<br />
violence, poverty, and war. He had an idea! Maybe we can<br />
skip WW5 entirely by presenting the Quine simulator to the<br />
