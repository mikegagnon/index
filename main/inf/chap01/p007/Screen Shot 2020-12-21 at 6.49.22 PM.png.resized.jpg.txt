The Quine Simulator

On March 2, 2042, the world was nearing the end of World
War 4, the war of cyber-kinetic nuclear terrorism, and Profes-
sor Steve was a computer scientist working at MIT Lincoln
Laboratory. At the time, LL was MIT’s largest laboratory
and the entirety of LL’s work was classified research and de-
velopment for the United States’ Department of Defense. A
little known fact about LL was that LL accounted for slightly
over half of MIT’s total budget, which becomes unsurpris-
ing when you consider that they were building things such
as the world’s most high-fidelity reality simulator, the Quine
simulator.

Quine operates by simulating the interactions of subatomic
particles. Just as intelligence emerges from particle interac-
tions in reality,! so does it play out in Quine. Well, mostly.
For performance reasons, Quine doesn’t simulate the interac-
tions of elementary particles. Rather, Quine simulates the in-
teractions of particles one layer above in the holarchy, namely:
protons, neutrons, etc.. This performance enhancement cre-
ated a problem, however. Specifically, the early tests with
Quine lead to an unexpectedly chaotic world, and humanity
