34 CHAPTER 12. SUPER HACKER DELUXE

their classification of Deluxe as a superpower in an effort to
drive pro-truce speech into silence.

Pro-truce speech was Deluxe’s specialty. In the beginning,

their earliest members engineered a meme-synthesis machine—
a data-mining AI that scrapes popular memes from the Web,

then pipes those memes into another AI, which tastefully pro-

duces new memes embedding pleas for truce. Sometimes the

message is explicit and sometimes it’s subliminal. The ma-

chine’s memes were highly localized; they often catered to

specific individuals’ sensibilities.

The machine was necessarily distributed, for the main job
of most members of Deluxe was to feed their ideation, their
world perspective, into the machine so the machine could tar-
get like-minded individuals.
