Fast Bounty

On December 5, 2009, the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) released 10 red weather balloons scattered

across the United States. In advance, DARPA had issued a

challenge: the first team to successfully report the location of

all ten balloons will win $40,000.

Many teams scrambled to recruit their social networks to hunt
for the balloons. The MIT team won the challenge, and, in the
process, they discovered a new social-networking algorithm.

The MIT team basically used an economically sound version
of a pyramid scheme to recruit balloon hunters. Hereâ€™s how
it worked. The MIT team announced that if they won the
challenge they would give out prizes. For each balloon found,
they offered a $2,000 prize to the first person to report that
balloon. Furthermore, whoever told that person about the
competition would win $1000. And whoever told that person
about the competition would win $500, and so on.

The algorithm came to be known as Time Critical Social Mo-
bilization (TCSM), and immediately fell into obscurity. How-
ever, on June 3, 2024 Gloriane Denault revived it by releasing
a mobile app implementing TCSM, called Fast Bounty. The
