48 CHAPTER 18. FAST BOUNTY

way it works is you type in an objective, an expiration time,
and some details, then transfer your prize money into the
appâ€™s escrow account. Then, Fast Bounty publicizes your ob-
jective and prize. If no one accomplishes the objective before
the prize expires, the money is returned from the escrow ac-
count. But if someone accomplishes the objective, the app
distributes the prize money.

With the Fast Bounty app, lost puppies are found within
hours for even low bounties.
