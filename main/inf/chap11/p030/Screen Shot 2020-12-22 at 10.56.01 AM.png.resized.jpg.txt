30CHAPTER 11. PROVING GODEL’S LOST THEOREM

Professor Steve accepted the paper, and sat down on the
table. He carefully wrote: “Gédel’s Lost Theorem,” then
rapidly scribbled out what would appear to most people as
nothing but nonsense:

c; & stmt[i = j].1 = truthy
co “to < stmtfi = j].t < stmifi = j]t+8<t
cz “ consistency(j) < B

z 1 ifexAcAc3
Je | 0 otherwise

(torts) & 1 ifqAc

Eyes { 0 otherwise

For years, Professor Steve had a hobby of attempting to prove
Gédel’s Lost Theorem, though he kept this hobby a secret,
because only cranks worked on the problem.

“I haven’t yet figured out why mathematicians can’t grok
Gédel’s Lost Theorem,” said a woman’s voice from behind

Professor Steve.

Professor Steve turned around, and shot at her: “So you’ve
solved Gédel’s Lost Theorem?”

She stepped back, then said, “If you believe contradictory
beliefs long enough, the contradictions resolve themselves, re-
vealing the inherent consistency underneath.”

“You're crazy,” he told her.

“Yes, I’m crazy, but I’m also sane.”

Professor Steve turned away. There was a pause. He turned
back to face her.
