32CHAPTER 11. PROVING GODEL’S LOST THEOREM

simulation.

For a few seconds, Professor Steve was the universe. He
looked into his own eyes staring back into him from the woman
standing in front of him, and everything made sense.

Normally, in Professor Steve’s day to day life, there’s an un-
dercurrent of an edge, even beneath enjoyable activities like
eating bananas. He had never noticed the edge before, but he
noticed it then, because it was absent. He felt the perfection
of calm and peace, more real than real.

Thoughts popped into existence for the first time since the
clap: “The Quine is a machine whose purpose is to compute
a consistent perspective from inconsistent perspectives. I am
a cog.”

A gleaming, detailed vision of peace, prosperity and a perma-
nent end of war rang through Professor Steve’s mind as he
coalesced back into his individual existence.

 

Professor Steve stood up, and looked at the woman. He said,
“How did you do that?”

“The Tibetan word for it is ‘nyam,”

she replied and smiled.
Professor Steve smiled, and asked, “Who are you?”

“I’m Super Hacker Deluxe, and I’m escaping at midnight.
You can join if you’d like.”

Carl showed up, “Oh no you're not.”
