Chapter 11

Proving Godel’s Lost
Theorem

Professor Steve sat in a crowded room, dressed in worn down
scrubs, slowly writing on a piece of unruled white paper with
a yellow crayon. After several minutes, he held it out in front
of him, squinting, trying to get the light to hit the crayon
words just right. It read, “Legal defense: Please have mercy
on me, I was trying to be a patriot.”

He carefully folded his latest legal defense, walked into his
room from the common area, and placed his defense on the
nightstand, next to the others. He looked in the plastic mir-
ror. His black eye was healing, and he possessed the beginning
of a scruffy beard.

With his yellow crayon in hand, Professor Steve walked back
out into the common area and approached the nurses’ station.

“May I have a few more sheets of paper, please?” He asked.
“Yes, but then that’s the last for you for the rest of the day,”

Carl replied.
