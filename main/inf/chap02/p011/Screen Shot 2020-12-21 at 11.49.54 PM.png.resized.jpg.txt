The Infinite Corridor

The scientists were puzzled. The Quine was only running
in realtime; the fast-forward button wasn’t working. They
looked around, and saw that no one was looking, so they
took a peek, hoping for clues about their problem.

Professor Steve and his colleagues looked at their monitor in
horror. They were tuned into a video feed from their Quine
simulator, observing what was happening in the simulated
reality. More specifically, they were watching a video feed of
simulated versions of themselves, watching a video feed of the
simulation within the simulation within the simulation...

It hadn’t occurred to them beforehand that if they simulated
Quine within Quine, that the simulated scientists would also
simulate Quine within the simulated Quine, and so on... cre-
ating an infinite regression of Quines, because every simula-
tion of Quine includes a simulation of Quine.

Over the speakers, Professor Steve and his colleagues heard
one of the simulated scientists say: “I think the probability
that we’re living in a simulation just skyrocketed.”

There was a pause. Then someone in the room said: “I think
