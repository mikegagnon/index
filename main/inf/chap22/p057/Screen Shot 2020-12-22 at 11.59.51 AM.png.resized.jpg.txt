Chapter 22

Public Statement

The Fast Bounty app delivered the message to Dr. Sam Harris
in just shy of 24 hours, while Professor Steve was in solitary
confinement in Boston’s city jail. Urged by his assistant to
make a public statement, Dr. Sam Harris wrote on Twitter:
“Just received Professor Steven Careball’s manifesto on world
peace and intelligent design. It’s crank nonsense.”

Professor Steve’s parents visited him in jail and delivered the
news to him delicately.
