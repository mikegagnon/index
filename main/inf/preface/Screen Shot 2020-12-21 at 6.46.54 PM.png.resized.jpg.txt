Preface

The calculus of infinity is strange. For instance, there are
an infinite number of positive whole numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6...). And, there are also an infinite number of whole numbers
(... -8, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...). Yet, there are about half as many
positive whole numbers as there are whole numbers. So, there
are degrees of infinity.

But really, nothing is infinite. Itâ€™s just a mathematical con-
struct to help us think about reality.
