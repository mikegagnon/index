friends, who were entertained and enjoyed hearing from Pro-
fessor Steve. None of them took his writing too seriously
though; they all believed he was crazy. But they couldn’t
help acknowledging that he had interesting ideas.

Emboldened by his success, he eventually crafted a piece that
tells the essence of his story in the form of a fictional novella,
titled The Infinite Regression.

As usual, Professor Steve’s friends appreciated hearing from
him, and some even enjoyed this particular story more than
the previous ones. And while most would deny it, Professor
Steve did make an impression on many of their world views.
Later, these impressions slowly blossomed and crept around
Earth’s social network, until finally, 23 years after Professor
Steve’s adventure, his story’s modest contribution to the rich
chain of causality eventually reached world leaders, minutely
nudging the final negotiations of WW5, ushering in peace,
prosperity, a permanent end of war, and a pardon for Profes-
sor Steve.

He also received a $1 trillion settlement, which he used to pay
back his parents.
