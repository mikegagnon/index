Chapter 19

Last Ditch Effort

Professor Steve and everyone slowly stepped out of the van
onto the snow with their hands up.

As the voice from megaphone shouted, “Keep your hands up,”
Professor Steve felt the pressure of averting both annihilation
and WW5 reach a crescendo. This was the end of his simu-
lation’s run, Professor Steve thought. He clenched his eyes,
expecting to be annihilated. But it didn’t happen. And, a
far-out idea popped into his mind. He needed a cell phone
and just a little bit of time.

Professor Steve mustered all his courage, then jumped back
into the van, started the ignition, and slammed the gas pedal.
The SWAT team scrambled. Clipped into the AC vent, a
holster held the driver’s cell phone, unlocked.

Professor Steve swerved left and squeezed through a gap be-
tween unmarked police cars. Gunfire sounded and his tires
were shot out, then he sped forward driving as fast as the
van would let him, which was 10 mph. The SWAT team gave
chase, and a helicopter hovered overhead shining a spotlight
onto Professor Steve’s dashboard.
