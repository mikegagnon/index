CHAPTER 13. MANIFESTO

rule Earth. Perhaps they would be satisfied if we
add “In God we trust” to our global constitution.
While such an article appears to violate the sep-
aration of church and state for most democratic
and communist countries, we can, if we choose,
lawfully amend our nation states’ constitutions to
include “In God we trust.” The supreme courts
can reconcile the seeming contradiction between
separation of church and state, and “In God we
trust.” And for the scientifically-minded atheists
who object, consider how everything that tran-
spires ultimately boils down to the interactions of
elementary particles. Therefore, we lack free will,
and therefore either everything is intelligently de-
signed, or nothing is intelligently designed. So, if
you believe in intelligence, you necessarily believe
in intelligent design. Denying the existence of in-
telligence is equivalent to denying the existence
of the words you are reading right now. At one
level of reality, ultimate reality, there is no intelli-
gence and there are no words and you don’t even
exist either. But at another level, the level where
you exist and words exist, intelligence exists so we
must accept the existence of intelligent design and
that everything is intelligently designed.
