Steve’s mind, his complete flushed-out argument went some-
thing like this:

At the deepest level of reality, there’s just particles
moving around according to the laws of physics.
At this level of reality, I don’t exist, no one exists,
and nothing exists except just particles. And yet,
“T” am here, “you” are here, this “cup of water”
is here, and so on. So, it makes sense to think
in terms of ultimate reality (where nothing ex-
ists), and my subjective reality (where all sorts of
things exist), and furthermore subjective reality is
derived from ultimate reality. On one hand, free
will doesn’t exist (in ultimate reality), but on the
other hand, I have the experience of free will so it
does exist (in subjective reality).

Now, moving on into the subject of intelligent de-
sign. At this moment, the particles of the universe
are arranged in a particular formation, a forma-
tion that gives rise to all sorts of subjective reali-
ties, and the DNA for this formation was embed-
ded in the Big Bang. So, the question arises: was
this present formation intelligently designed? Or
in other words: was the DNA for our universe in-
telligently designed? There are two possibilities:
(1) the DNA for our universe was not intelligently
designed, or (2) it was intelligently designed.

Since we experience intelligence in subjective real-
ity, we cannot deny intelligence, and it is thus clear
that at the level of subjective reality, we must ac-
cept the proposition that the DNA of our universe
was intelligently designed and, thus everything is
intelligently designed. Therefore it is rational to
believe that God exists in subjective reality. QED.
