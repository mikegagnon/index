52 CHAPTER 20. SAM HARRIS

It takes an act of imagination, conscious or uncon-
scious, to draw a circle around a group of particles
and call it a thing. Your brain has unconsciously
drawn a boundary around a certain cloud of par-
ticles and your brain calls it “me.” Like the Big
Dipper, “you” are imaginary. You, and everyone
else, and everything else, are figments of imagina-
tion. Photons pass through your pupils and strike
the inside of your eye balls. Based upon those
photon collisions, your brain unconsciously draws
an image, which you see. You never see reality
directly; rather, you only see your mental model’s
imaginary interpretation of reality.

With this understanding in mind, consider every-
thing in the universe: the galaxies, stars, plan-
ets, protons, laptops, the Internet, humans... and
remove all the labels that we project onto the
particles of the universe. Underneath the covers,
all that is left are naked particles. Those parti-
cles move along purely according to the laws of
physics. The universe is one giant machine that
simply ticks along, completely independent of how
we might label various groups of particles. Every
particle in every human’s body ticks along, in-
dependent of our imaginary conceptualization of
“me” and everything else. To quote Dr. Marvin
Minsky: “according to the modern scientific view,
there is simply no room at all for freedom of the
human will.”

Professor Steve had realized that the New Atheists’ view on
the universe was one short step away from realizing the exis-
tence of God. He hoped he could persuade Sam Harris to be-
lieve in God, triggering an avalanche amongst the New Athe-
ists that cascades down to the general population, bringing
Professor Steve’s vision for world peace to life. In Professor
