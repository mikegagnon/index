Sam Harris

In 2042, at the age of 75, Dr. Sam Harris was the most in-
fluential leader of the bastion of New Atheism. In contrast
to meek “old atheism,” the New Atheists publicly denounced
religion as fundamentally harmful, citing millennia of abuses
of power, warfare, and other misdeeds. They believed every-
one should be converted to a strictly rational, skeptical, and
scientific mindset.

While Sam Harris was never able to succinctly and eloquently
describe his view on free will, one of his students put it like
this:

Through an act of imagination, one can draw a
boundary around a star formation and call it “The
Big Dipper.” The Big Dipper does not inherently
exist; rather, it is merely a concept that requires
an act of imagination for it to exist. If all life in
the universe suddenly died, then there would be
no one to draw the boundary, and therefore the
Big Dipper would cease to exist. The concept of
the Big Dipper can only exist in living minds. In
this sense, the Big Dipper is “imaginary.”
