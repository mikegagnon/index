Chapter 15

The Escape

Professor Steve and Super Hacker Deluxe ran across a snowy
field in their socks, as fast as they could.

“Stop!” shouted Carl as he chased them, his sneakers squeak,
squeak, squeaking all along.

“That’s my van!” Deluxe shouted as they ran, pointing to
white plumber’s van at the edge of the field.

Professor Steve saw the van in the distance. It looked like
its side door was open, and there was a person dressed in all
black, wearing a ski mask leaning out the van, extending their
arm.

Carl chased them closing the gap, squeaking. Professor Steve
and Deluxe ran. But, Carl had focused his exercises on body-
building, not aerobics, so his muscles only weighed him down.
He keeled over, with his hands on his knees, panting and giv-
ing up.

Professor Steve and Deluxe reached the van, Deluxe extended

her arm, and the mysterious person pulled her in. Professor
Steve jump in, the tires screeched, and the van took off.
