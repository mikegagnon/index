Chapter 17

Inside the Van

“Who’s this?” asked a man’s voice behind the ski mask.

“He just had his first nyam,” replied Shelli, buckling herself
in.

Professor Steve buckled in, and looked towards Shelli as the
driver accelerated hard, pushing them against the back of
their seats. The van turned onto the Massachusetts Turnpike,
and decelerated to a steady speed.

The man pulled off his ski mask and extended a handshake
to Professor Steve: “I’m Joe.”

“Professor Steve,” said Professor Steve, and they shook hands.

By now, Joe was in the passenger seat next to the driver. He
had his body craned around towards Professor Steve. “What
did you learn in your nyam?” Joe asked.

Professor Steve pondered his move. If he could persuade Su-
per Hacker Deluxe, right now, to evolve their position on a
truce, maybe we could launch the process of averting WW5
right now.
