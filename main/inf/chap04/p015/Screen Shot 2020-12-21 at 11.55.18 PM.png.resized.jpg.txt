Chapter 4

The Chain of Command

Each of the Professor Steves across the Infinite Regression
ran to their bosses, who, in each case, was the Chief Technol-
ogy Officer of LL, Dr. Quimby. Each of those stories went
something like this one:

Professor Steve approached the open door to her office. She
was heads down, typing on her laptop. Professor Steve knocked
on her door.

She looked up at him: “Did you figure out a truce?”

“Yes, and no,” he responded.

“Tell me the ‘no’ part first.”

“T plugged the Quine into the Quine, to see how world leaders
would respond to the Quine.”

She stared at him calmly for a few seconds.
“Are we in an infinite regression?”
“Um, well, yes.”
