16 CHAPTER 4. THE CHAIN OF COMMAND

“You are never to reveal anything about The Quine Project
to anyone, under any circumstances. The Quine Project is

“You’re dismissed,” she said.

Professor Steve turned and walked away.

“Professor Steve, one more thing.”

He turned back towards her.

“Don’t try the Emergency Doorman Protocol, or you’ll spend

the rest of your life in prison,” and with that she closed her
door.
