Chapter 9

The Psych Ward

“This is the last time I’m going to explain it to you. You
have bipolar disorder and you’re manic right now and you’re
psychotic right now. You attempted to evade the police, and
when they found you, thank heaven they did, you were wear-
ing socks in the snow. Therefore you’re a danger to yourself
or others. And therefore, we are hospitalizing you and you
are not free to leave.”

“I’m not crazy,” Professor Steve murmured while holding an
icepack over his black eye.

“Carl, give him 20 mg each of haloperidol and diazepam.”

A large muscle-bound man approached Professor Steve with
two syringes pointing at him.

“Whatever, I give up,” Professor Steve said, and leaned back
in his chair. He felt a pinch in his skin, then the room faded
out.
