Godel’s Lost Theorem

Generally speaking, math should make sense. Which is to
say, mathematical systems should not contain contradictions.
Consider an example. Say someone posed to you a mathe-
matical system that proclaimed that 2 and 2 is four, and 2
and 2 is also 5. You would reject that mathematical system
because it doesn’t make sense: it contains a contradiction,
since 4 does not equal 5.

Historically, the vast majority of mathematicians have re-
jected mathematical systems that contain contradictions. But
then, in 1930 a mathematician named Kurt Gédel announced
his discovery that every consistent mathematical system con-
tains a weakness. Specifically, every consistent mathematical
system contains truths that cannot be proven to be true! For
example, you may think that God does or does not exist, but
if you use consistent logic it might just be the case that it’s
impossible for you to prove your case.

At first no one believed Gédel, for his claim was outrageous.
All the other mathematicians at the time had assumed that if
a statement were true, it must be possible to prove its truth
using consistent mathematics. So, Gédel’s colleagues scruti-
nized his proof, hoping to find a flaw and embarrass him.
