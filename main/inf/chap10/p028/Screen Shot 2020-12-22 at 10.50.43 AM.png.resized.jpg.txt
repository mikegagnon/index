28 CHAPTER 10. GODEL’S LOST THEOREM

But... they found zero contradictions, and, eventually, every-
one conceded Gédel’s Theorem was true.

Fast forwarding to the year 2027, a librarian with a knack
for reading illegible handwriting discovered what came to be
known as Gédel’s Lost Theorem. The newly discovered the-
orem stated that it is possible to prove every true statement
using consistent logic; a direct contradiction to Gédel’s The-
orem! Yet, according to Gédel’s proof, both theorems remain
valid due to inconsistent logic.

As late as 2042, the vast majority of mathematicians rejected
Gédel’s proof for his Lost Theorem. In their published papers,
they speculated that his use of inconsistent logic was due to
the madness he experienced late in his life.
